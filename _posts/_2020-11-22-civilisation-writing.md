W. B. YEATS&ensp;(Irish, 1865–1939)&ensp;[13] <br/>
>Turning and turning in the widening gyre <br/>
>The falcon cannot hear the falconer; <br/>
>Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; <br/>
>Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, <br/>
>The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere <br/>
>The ceremony of innocence is drowned; <br/>
>The best lack all conviction, while the worst <br/> 
>Are full of passionate intensity.
