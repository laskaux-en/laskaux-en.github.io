> _My Fair Lady_ isn’t a love story or a princess myth. It is a story of transformation, though perhaps not the one we expect.<br />

Indeed. For years, I’d been left the impression of _My Fair Lady_ being a fairy tale—charming, vibrant, witty, yet too miraculous to be real, too elegant to be affecting—until I walked into the Vivian Beaumont Theater, where I was showered with immense joy and pain. 

Lerner & Loewe’s comedy isn’t merely about how individual lives could be reshaped by phonetics in unexpected ways, and it extends beyond a reflection on gender roles and social classes in Edwardian England. At the heart of _My Fair Lady_ are the elations and tears of the ones wishing to rewrite their fates, and the inherent intellectual strength and emotional weakness of human beings. While laughing and clapping, we might suddenly discover the bittersweet lesson behind the amusing story, the moment we start suspecting if the front curtain is just a mirror. 

A considerable fraction of the fascination of _My Fair Lady_ originates from the straight play it is based on—George Bernard Shaw’s _Pygmalion_. But the creativities of Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe aren’t secondary—musicalizing _Pygmalion_ without diluting its linguistic charm and dramatic tension would be a delicate task. Lerner and Loewe did it respectfully—the storyline, characters, and spoken dialogue of their musical are mostly inherited from the play. Consequently, the depth and sharpness of the Shavian classic are very well preserved. 

However great the book is, any musical would pale without its score. “‘What is too silly to be said may be sung’—well, yes; but what is too subtle to be said, or too deeply felt, or too revealing or too mysterious—these things can also be sung and only be sung.” The remark by Kenneth Clark in his _Civilisation_ can’t be better illustrated by _My Fair Lady_—when the dialogue takes a breath, music cuts in, amplifying the exhilaration, believes, wishes, prejudice, disdain, or confusion of the roles, then gives the floor back to words. Verbal wits and sensual pleasures constructively interfere, performing a duet that is delightfully serious and seriously delightful. 

Meanwhile, music possesses a unique descriptive power. Songs form characters, often nearly define them—the whistling cockneys at Covent Garden, the grumbling servants at 27A Wimpole Street, the aristocratic gathering at Ascot, the mindlessly-in-love Freddy, and—the most vivid of all—Alfred P. Doolittle, the dancing and orating epicurean who can barely afford liquors but not morals. The hero and heroine, however, can’t be delineated even by five songs each. One has to go through every single line to decode the impetus of their fates.<br /><br />


## The invincible Galatea

She wasn’t noble, but had no fear. She sought from the crowd for witness to protect herself against the mistaken charge. She insisted on checking the “detective’s” notebook to ensure she’s free of accusation. She promised to call the police if being mistreated in the “boarding school.” She greeted a scorning gentleman with the spirit of a true citizen: “I’ve a right to be here if I like, same as you.”

She was poor, but never fell. She never drinks despite her bibulous family. She won’t be tempted by gold and diamonds. She struggled for her lodging, whereas still dreamed of warmth and love. As she constantly reminds herself and the world: “I’m a good girl, I am!” 

It would be a huge mistake to think the pre-metamorphosis Eliza merely as a boisterous flowergirl desperate for every tuppence. Although in a less graceful condition, she lived with dignity, discipline, and hope. But nothing could match her knocking on the door of 27A Wimpole Street to negotiate the details of that mocking offer of speech training—she managed to filter out the condescendence, and seize the opportunity to learn and reform. She wouldn’t be easily hurt, but never supplicated. She reasoned that English lessons shouldn’t cost more than French lessons, and yet proposed a tuition that surprised the celebrated phoneticist, considering her limited income. 

An experiment was launched, but yields unanticipated results: After four months, at the Ascot races, she already acquired a glorious pronunciation, yet didn’t know what to talk. Six weeks later, at the Embassy Ball, she could speak and behave like the most charming princess. The linguistic experiment per se should be called a success. Nevertheless, Eliza is transformed into not a lady but a perfect doll, who can only be manipulated and rely on the kindness of others. 

Earlier on that cold spring night, she sat on a dustcart, picked up cabbage leaves as fans, and sang the sweetest melody in London:

>All I want is a room somewhere; <br />
>Far away from the cold night air. <br />
>With one enormous chair; <br />
>Oh, wouldn’t be loverly? <br />
>. . . <br />
>Someone’s head restin’ on my knee; <br />
>Warm and tender as he can be, <br />
>Who takes good care of me; <br />
>Oh, wouldn’t it be loverly?

Six months later, she sits in a luxurious armchair next to a fireplace, without feeling a bit of warmth. She converses with duchesses, dances with princes, yet not receiving any care. She hurls the slippers at her Professor and escapes from her private school. At Covent Garden, besides the old columns and folks, she hums her _Loverly_ tune, weeping. She now belongs to nowhere—too genteel to be a flowergirl, yet too weak to be a lady. She gets everything in her dream, but nothing is lovely.

It’s not the end of the transformation. It’s only the beginning, the first step in a new world. 

She leaves her egocentric and manipulative tutor. She dries her tears and moves on—this time, with an elegant speech and an indomitable heart, which has endured the pains as she learns to tell “Spain” from “Spine,” domination from care, limerence from love, and etiquette from respect. She doesn’t mind evolving into a more cultured Ms. Doolittle, and meanwhile will remain that _loverly_ Eliza.

That’s the making of the fairest lady.<br /><br />


## The vulnerable Pygmalion

He lives in his profession. He invents his own universal alphabets and arranges his home like a phonetic laboratory. He can pronounce 130 different vowels and place a person by their accent within six miles in England or two miles in London. To him, an articulate speech is a divine gift from the God:

>Think what you’re dealing with. The majesty and grandeur of the English language. It’s the greatest possession we have. The noblest sentiments that ever flowed in the hearts of men are contained in its extraordinary, imaginative and musical mixtures of sounds.

He sincerely believes so.

The world of Henry Higgins is simple and orderly—he uses the laws of linguistics or science in general as the measure of everything. In his mind, humans are classified according to their speeches, and the attractiveness of a person is determined by either their intellectual capacity or the uniqueness of their dialect. He despises anyone who “incarnates insult to English language” regardless of their gender, look, status, or occupation. He has equally low esteem for the uneducated populace and the pretentious, empty-headed nobles. He detests all characters against rationality, independence, and serenity. He is extremely principled, and assumes his principles ought to be obeyed by the whole civilized world. Of course, they aren’t. 

His contentious beliefs are challenged by Eliza. He can’t understand why the grand success of his experiment leads to her emotional breakdown. Moreover, he observes a strange feeling that has never existed before: 

>I was serenely independent and content before we met; <br />
>Surely I could always be that way again—and yet <br />
>I’ve grown accustomed to her looks; <br />
>Accustomed to her voice; <br />
>Accustomed to her face. <br />

At Mrs. Higgins’ place, he is defeated by the new Lady Eliza. He encounters his own coldness and arrogance. He is told how hurtful his words and deeds can be, and that he plays nothing but a replaceable role to any living creature. Yet he has no choice but to confess—acknowledging the truth complies with his values more than pretending to be deaf.

The 2018 Lincoln Center Theater production ends in an air of melancholy—Eliza enters with her voice played on a gramophone, delivers her famous last line, and exits downstage, slowly disappearing from Higgins’ sight. Note that aisles haven’t been used as exits in interior scenes throughout the show, which, in my opinion, implies Eliza’s last presence is imaginary. In reality, as she promised, she never sees him again. He bids farewell to her—a rare counterpart of him, who truly appreciates his enthusiasm, shares his perseverance, and perceives his frailty. He will start a new chapter of his life, this time, learning to be a human.<br /><br />


## Being transformed, who are we?

Higgins’ lady training program isn’t purely fictitious—in reality, we call it education, the systematic procedure through which young people may change their fates. Many are undergoing a metamorphosis no easier than that of Eliza, especially those pursuing higher education at a prestigious university in a foreign country.

I’m now a few years older than Eliza, yet still struggling to accurately pronounce the fifteen distinct vowels in American English: the near-close near-front unrounded /ɪ/, the near-close near-back rounded /ʊ/, etc. I’m rebuilding my vocabulary, using the handbooks intended for teenagers or those without a decent education. I’m assimilating a different set of attitudes and methods in scientific research. I’m resetting my knowledge, especially that on social sciences and humanities. I’m acquiring the basic skills of writing and communication. I’m overhauling my manners and values. There are nights I couldn’t put my books down, either too concentrated or too occupied. There are also “The Rain in Spain” moments, when “at once my heart took flight.” I’m surrounded by enlightening mentorships, as well as aimless zeal. I’ve be constantly encouraged, yet occasionally mocked. 

We’re exploring a world we’ve never been to. We’re being transformed into someone we aren’t familiar with. We’re approaching thousands of new excitements, yet distanced from many simple joys. We’re gaining knowledge and achievements, but they don’t naturally bring care or love.

We can spend a night dancing or weeping. But when the morning is smearing up the sky, we’d go back to our phonetic charts, or any endeavor we choose to undertake. 

Most importantly, however “ladylike” we’ll become in the coming years, never let the spirit of that vigorous, fearless flowergirl be taken away from us—that’s what launched the transformation, and what essentially powers it. Some day in the future, when hesitating or lost, we shall recall the courage inside us the moment we knocked on the door of our 27A Wimpole Street and said:

“I washed my face and hands before I come. If you were a gentleman, you would ask me to sit down.”<br /><br />
