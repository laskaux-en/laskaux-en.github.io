>Comme il faut de la VERTU dans une république, et dans une monarchie, de l'hon-neur, il faut de la CRAINTE dans un gouvernement despotique: pour la vertu, elle n'yest point nécessaire, et l'honneur y serait dangereux..

#### <br/> 10 July 1793: Danton quit the _Comité de salut public_

> The Commune and the Mountain had effected this revolution against the Gironde, and the committee alone had bene ted by it. During the five months from June to November, the committee, having taken all the measures of defence, had naturally become the first power in the republic. The actual struggle being, as it were, over, the commune sought to sway the committee, and the Mountain to throw off its yoke. The most intense manifestation of the revolution was found in the municipal faction. With an aim opposed to that of the committee of public safety, it desired instead of the conventional dictatorship, the most extreme local democracy . . .
>
> The committee of public safety was too strong not to triumph over the commune; but, at the same time, it had to resist the moderate party of the Mountain, which demanded the cessation of the revolutionary government and the dictatorship of the committees. The revolutionary government had only been created to restrain, the dictatorship to conquer; and as Danton and his party no longer considered restraint and victory essential, they sought to establish legal order, and the independence of the convention; they wished to throw down the faction of the commune, to stop the operation of the revolutionary tribunal, to empty the prisons now filled with suspected persons, to reduce or destroy the powers of the committees. This project in favour of clemency, humanity, and legal government, was conceived by Danton, Philippeaux, Camille Desmoulins, Fabre-d’Eglantine, Lacroix, general Westermann, and all the friends of Danton. Before all things they wanted that _the republic should secure the field of battle_; but after conquest, they wished to conciliate.
> 
> This party, become moderate, had renounced power; it had withdrawn from the government, or suffered itself to be excluded by Robespierre’s party. Moreover, since the 31st of May, zealous patriots had considered Danton’s conduct equivocal. He had acted mildly on that day, and had subsequently disapproved the condemnation of the twenty-two. They began to reproach him with his disorderly life, his venal passions, his change of party, and untimely moderation. To avoid the storm, he had retired to his native place, **Arcis-sur-Aube**, and there he seemed to have forgotten all in retirement.  &nbsp;[FAM]

Danton resigned from the Committee of Public Safety in July and refused to be reelected on 6 September, leaving the remark "I won't be a member of any committee, but the spur of them all." Due to illness, he obtained leave of absence on 12 October and didn't return until late November. 

> On the very day that the Norman insurrection was crushed at Vernon, a Norman girl stabbed Marat. . . . That most striking and picturesque episode concerns us only in this matter, that it was a powerful impetus to the system of the Terror, and such an one as Danton, with all his judgment, could not possibly have foreseen. . . .
>
>Let us see how the misfortunes of the country reacted upon the position of Danton. Already, with early July, he felt himself pressed and constrained by the growing power of the Jacobin doctrine and of its high priest. . . . Just upon the 8th of July, which, though history has called it moderate, yet mentions the accusation of Yergniaud and of Gaudet, and to this Danton was forced reluctantly to put his name. Two days afterwards the old Committee to which he had belonged was dissolved and a new one was elected. 
>
>It would be an error to regard this as a mere resignation on the part of Danton; it would be equally an error to regard it as a violent censure on the part of the Convention. It is certain that he chose to withdraw because the fatal necessity of things was giving power to men of whom he had no opinion. Thus **Robespierre joined the Committee on the 27th of July**—Robespierre, of whom Danton could say in private, " The man has not wits enough to cook an egg." Yet this was the man who was so worshipped by the crowd, that, once within the Committee, he was destined to become the master of France. It may be remarked in passing that something fatal seemed to attach to the date on which a man entered and began to lead the Committee. On the day that Danton entered in '93, on that day was he guillotined in '94. On the day that Robespierre entered in '93, on that day in '94 he fell.

>He was ill already ; the great energies which had been poured out recklessly in a torrent had suddenly run dry. . . . he asked and obtained permission to leave the Convention. It was upon the 12 th of October, just as the worst phase of the Terror was beginning, that he left the violence and noise of the city and turned his face eastward to the cool valley of the Marne.

#### <br/> 17 September 1793: Law of Suspects

> On 17 September a comprehensive Law of Suspects was passed, which empowered the watch committees set up the previous March to arrest anyone who ‘either by their conduct, their contacts, their words or their writings, showed themselves to be supporters of tyranny, of federalism, or to be enemies of liberty’, as well as a number of more specific categories such as former nobles ‘who have not constantly manifested their attachment to the revolution.’ Practically anybody might fall foul of such a sweeping law. . . . Then on 29 September the Convention passed a General Maximum Law which imposed price controls on a wide range of goods defined as of first necessity from food and drink to fuel, clothing, and even tobacco. Those who sold them above the maximum would be fined and placed on the list of suspects. . . .
>
> Thus began the most famous stage of the French Revolution, when in the course of nine months around 16,000 people perished under the blade of the guillotine. The cold, mechanical efficiency of the method had all Europe watching with fascinated horror. The Terror began—and ended far into 1794—with famous victims. Marie-Antoinette went to the scaffold, her defiant appearance in the tumbril memorably sketched by David, on 17 October. Two weeks later (31 October) 21 Girondins, including Brissot and Vergniaud, followed her, after a show trial cut short when the eloquence and debating skills of the accused threatened to prolong it indefinitely. They went to their deaths defiantly singing the ‘Marseillaise’. . . . Of those who had escaped in June, four went to the guillotine in Bordeaux, while Pétion and Buzot shot themselves. Their bodies were later found, half-eaten by wolves. Roland too committed suicide when he heard of his wife’s execution in November. November. November also saw the execution of . . . Bailly, still hated by the sansculottes for his part in the massacre of the Champ de Mars. For him a special guillotine was erected at the scene of the crime. The others all met their deaths where the guillotine now permanently stood, close to where Louis XVI’s head had fallen in the place de la Révolution. &nbsp;[WD]


#### 14–16 October 1793: Trial and Execution of Marie-Antoinette

Publicly prosecuted by **Antoine Fouquier-Tinville** (Yves Beneyton) on 14 October, Marie-Antoinette is trialed by the Revolutionary Tribunal presided over by **Martial Herman** (Ronald Guttman).

>She was in black. A little scarf of lace was laid with exactitude about her shoulders and her breast, and on her head she wore a great cap which a woman who loved her, the same who had served her in her cell, put on her as she went to her passion. The pure white of this ornament hung in great strings  of lawn on either side, and round it and beneath it she had wound  the crape of her widowhood. So dressed, and so standing at the bar, so watched in silence by so many eyes, she heard once more the new sound which yesterday she had first learned to hate: the hard and nasal voice of Herman. He asked her formally her name. She answered in a voice which was no longer strong, but which was still clear and well heard in that complete silence: 
>
>“Marie Antoinette of Austria, some thirty-eight years old, 
widow to Louis Capet the King of France.” 
>
>To the second formal question on the place of her first arrest, that : 
>
>“It was in the place where the sittings of the National Assembly were held.” 
>
> . . .
>
>Last of these witnesses Hébert, all neat and powdered, presented his documents and put forward his abominations, his fixed idea of incest. The public disgust might here have turned the trial. There was a stir all round: her friends began to hope. As for the officials, they could not stop Hébert’s mouth, but Herman was careful to omit the customary repetition: he was hurrying on to the next witness when a juryman of less wit than his fellows and filled with the enormous aberrations of hate, pressed the charge. 
>
>The Queen would not reply. She half rose from her chair 
and cried in a high voice: "I appeal to every mother here," 
and then sank back again.
> <p align="right">—Hilaire Belloc, <em>Marie Antoinette</em> (1909)

The verdict is declared in the early morning of 16 October:

> The cold violence of formal law still dominated the lawyers. Herman put forth the common exhortation of judges against applause or blame. He read to her the conclusions of the Jury: they were affirmative upon every point of the four. He asked her with that same cold violence of formality, after the Public Prosecutor had demanded the penalty of death set down for such actions as hers in the new Penal Code, whether she had anything to say against her sentence. She shook her head.

On the same day, dressed in white by her last servant **Rosalie Lamorlière** (Muriel Brenner) in front of the guards, Marie-Antoinette was taken to the Place de la Révolution (Place de la Concorde) in an open cart and guillotined by **Henri Sanson**, son of Charles-Henri Sanson.

#### Epilogue

>« Nous avons brisé la tyrannie des privilèges en abolissant ces pouvoirs auxquels n'avait droit aucun homme. 
>
> Nous avons mis fin au monopole de la naissance et de la fortune dans tous ces grands offices de l'État, dans nos églises, dans nos armées, dans toutes les parties de ce grand corps magnifique de la France.
>
> Nous avons déclaré que l'homme le plus humble de ce pays est l'égal des plus grands. 
>
> Cette liberté que nous avons acquise pour nous-mêmes nous l'avons affectée aux esclaves et nous confions au monde la mission de bâtir l'avenir sur l'espoir que nous avons fait naître.
>
> C'est plus qu'une victoire dans une bataille, plus que les épées et les canons et toutes les cavaleries de l'Europe et cette inspiration, ce souffle pour tous les hommes, partout en tout lieu, cet appétit, cette soif de liberté jamais rien ni personne ne pourra l'étouffer. 
>
> Nos vies n'auront pas été inutiles, nos vies n'auront pas été vécues en vain. »
