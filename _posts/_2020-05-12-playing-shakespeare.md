### I.&nbsp; The Two Traditions

["SPEAK THE SPEECH, I PRAY YOU"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuCv6IBml1M "Laurence Olivier as Hamlet, 1948 film")
: Hamlet's advice to the actors—an early modern guideline for theatrical acting:

> **HAMLET** &nbsp;(Alan Howard & Mike Gwilym) <br/>	
> Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth it as many of your players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. 
>
> **HAMLET** &nbsp;(David Suchet & Ben Kingsley) <br/>
> Be not too tame neither. But let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this special observance, that you o’erstep not the modesty of nature. For anything so o’erdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is to hold, as t’were, the mirror up to nature.

<br/> ["AN EAGLE IN A DOVE-COTE"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HukDnCyJ0MM "Alan Howard as Coriolanus, 1984 TV")
: Coriolanus's scorn for Aufidius and the Volscian conspirators—an example of Elizabethan lines:

> **CORIOLANUS** &nbsp;(Alan Howard)
> <br/>	Cut me to pieces, Volsces, men and lads,			
> <br/>	Stain all your edges on me. Boy! False hound!		 
> <br/>	If you have writ your annals true, ’tis there,	 
> <br/>	That like an eagle in a dove-cote, I 				
> <br/>	Flutter’d your Volscians in Corioles.				
> <br/>	Alone I did it. Boy!
> <p align="right">[<em>Cor.</em> V.vi.111–116]


<br/> ["IN SOOTH I KNOW NOT WHY I AM SO SAD"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EGBKuapkX4 "Anthony Nicholls as Antonio, Barry James as Salerio, and Michael Tudor aBarnes as Solanio, 1973 TV") 
: The opening of _The Merchant of Venice_—comparing a _naturalistic_ speech to a heightened one:

> **ANTONIO** &nbsp;(Ian McKellen)
> <br/>	_In sooth I know not why I am so sad.
> <br/>	It wearies me, you say it wearies you;
> <br/>	But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
> <br/>	What stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born,
> <br/>	I am to learn:
> <br/>	And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
> <br/>	That I have much ado to know myself._
>
> **SALERIO** &nbsp;(David Suchet)
> <br/>	Your mind is tossing on the ocean,
> <br/>	There where your argosies with portly sail
> <br/>	Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
> <br/>	Or as it were the pageants of the sea,
> <br/>	Do overpeer the petty traffickers
> <br/>	That cur’sy to them (do them reverence)
> <br/>	As they fly by them with their woven wings.
>
> **SOLANIO** &nbsp;(Ben Kingsley)
> <br/>	Believe me sir, had I such venture forth,
> <br/>	The better part of my affections would
> <br/>	Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
> <br/>	Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind,
> <br/>	Piring in maps for ports, and piers and roads:
> <br/>	And every object that might make me fear
> <br/>	Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
> <br/>	Would make me sad.
>
> **SALERIO** 
> <br/>	. . . I know Antonio
> <br/>	Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
>
> **ANTONIO**
> <br/>	Believe me no, I thank my fortune for it,
> <br/>	My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
> <br/>	Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
> <br/>	Upon the fortune of this present year:
> <br/>	Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
>
> **SOLANIO**   
> <br/>	Why then you are in love.
>
> **ANTONIO**
> <br/>	Fie, fie!
>
> **SOLANIO**   
> <br/>	Not in love neither: then let us say you are sad
> <br/>	Because you are not merry; and ’twere as easy
> <br/>	For you to laugh and leap, and say you are merry
> <br/>	Because you are not sad. . . .
> <p align="right">[<em>MV</em> I.i.1–22 & 39–50]


<br/> ["FAREWELL THE TRANQUIL MIND"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYnN4sTPKdU "Laurence Olivier as Othello and Frank Finlay as Iago, 1965 film") 
: Othello's self-perception after believing Desdemona's unfaithfulness—switching between heightened and _naturalistic_ language:

> **OTHELLO** &nbsp;(Alan Howard)
> <br/>	I had been happy if the general camp,
> <br/>	Pioneers and all, had tasted her sweet body,
> <br/>	So I had nothing known. O now for ever
> <br/>	Farewell the tranquil mind, farewell content!
> <br/>	Farewell the plumed troops and the big wars
> <br/>	That makes ambition virtue! O farewell,
> <br/>	Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,
> <br/>	The spirit-stirring drum, th’ear-piercing fife,
> <br/>	The royal banner, and all quality,
> <br/>	Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!
> <br/>	And, O you mortal engines whose rude throats
> <br/>	Th’immortal Jove’s dread clamours counterfeit,
> <br/>	Farewell: Othello’s occupation’s gone.
>
> **IAGO** &nbsp;(Mike Gwilym) 
> <br/>	_Is’t possible? my lord?_ 
> <p align="right">[<em>Oth.</em> III.iii.348–361]


### <br/> II.&nbsp; Using the Verse

["ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6pWPiNUiyg "Laurence Olivier as King Henry V of England, 1944 film") 
: King Henry motivates his troops to launch continuous assaults—the alternation of light and strong stresses in Shakespeare's verse:

> **KING HENRY V** &nbsp;(Michael Williams) 
>
> `DUM DUM de de de DUM, DUM DUM, DUM DUM`
> <br/>	Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
>
> `de DUM de DUM DUM de de DUM de DUM`
> <br/>	Or close the wall up with our English dead!
>
> `de DUM de DUM de DUM de DUM de DUM`
> <br/>	In peace there's nothing so becomes a man,
>
> `de DUM de DUM de de de DUM de DUM`
> <br/>	As modest stillness and humility;
>
> `de DUM de DUM de DUM DUM de de DUM`
> <br/>	But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
>
> `de DUM de DUM de DUM de DUM de DUM de`
> <br/>	Then imitate the action of the tiger:
>
> `DUM de de DUM DUM, DUM de DUM de DUM`
> <br/>	Stiffen the sinews, conjure up the blood,
>
> `de DUM DUM DUM de de DUM-DUM de DUM`
> <br/>	Disguise fair nature with hard-favoured rage.
> <p align="right">[<em>H5</em> III.i.1–8]


<br/> "GOOD QUEEN, MY LORD, GOOD QUEEN"
: Paulina tries to persuade Leontes of the virtuousness of Hermione—a line with ten stong stresses out of ten:

> **PAULINA** &nbsp;(Sheila Hancock)
>
> `DUM DUM, DUM DUM, DUM DUM; DUM DUM DUM DUM`
> <br/>	Good queen, my lord, good queen; I say good queen,
> <p align="right">[<em>WT</em> II.iii.59]


<br/> ["TIDE IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ay2I7py3Og "John Gielgud as Brutus") 
: Brutus advises Cassius to tackle the forces of Octavius and Antony—a line with fewer stresses than usual:

> **BRUTUS** &nbsp;(Jane Lapotaire)
>
> `de DUM de DUM de de de DUM de DUM`
> <br/>	There is a tide in the affairs of men
> <p align="right">[<em>JC</em> IV.iii.215]


<br/> ["TO BE, OR NOT TO BE"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ay2I7py3Og "Christopher Plummer as Hamlet, 1964 film") 
: Hamlet's contemplation of life and death—lines ended with an eleventh syllable, or the _feminine ending_:

> **HAMLET** &nbsp;(Alan Howard)
>
> `de DUM, de DUM de DUM, DUM de de DUM de`
> <br/>	To be, or not to be, that is the question:
>
> `DUM de de DUM de de de DUM de DUM de`
> <br/>	Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
>
> `de DUM de DUM de de DUM de DUM de`
> <br/>	The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
>
> `de de DUM DUM de DUM de DUM de DUM de`
> <br/>	Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
>
> `de DUM de DUM de DUM DUM`
> <br/>	And by opposing end them. . . .
> <p align="right">[<em>Ham.</em> III.i.56–60]


<br/> "HOW MIGHT A PRINCE FORGET"
: Prince Hal, or King Henry V reminds the Lord Chief Justice of the previous imprisonment of Hal—the necessity of the feminine ending:

> **PRINCE HAL** &nbsp;(Ian McKellen) 
>
> `de DUM de DUM de DUM DUM DUM de DUM`
> <br/> How might a prince of my great hopes forget
>
> `de DUM de DUM de DUM de DUM de DUM de`
> <br/> So great indignities you laid upon me?
> <p align="right">[<em>2H4.</em> V.ii.68–69]


<br/> "ARE THERE BALANCE HERE"
: Shylock prepares the scale to weigh Antonio's flesh—short verse lines as pauses:

> **SHYLOCK** &nbsp;(David Suchet)    
> <br/>	. . . O wise and upright judge,
> <br/>	How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
>
> **PORTIA** &nbsp;(Lisa Harrow) 
> <br/>	Therefore lay bare your bosom.
>
> **SHYLOCK**     
> <br/>	Ay, his breast,
> <br/>	So says the bond, doth it not noble judge?
> <br/>	‘Nearest his heart,’ those are the very words.
>
> **PORTIA**     
> <br/>	It is so.
> <br/>	Are there balance here to weigh the flesh?
>
> **SHYLOCK**     
> <br/>	I have them ready.
>
> **PORTIA**
> <br/>	Have by some surgeon Shylock on your charge,
> <br/>	To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.
> <p align="right">[<em>MV</em> IV.i.260–270]


<br/> "HE SHALL NOT LIVE. ENOUGH."
: King John proposes to his accomplice Hubert the murder of the young boy Arthur—the device of shared verse line:

> **KING JOHN** &nbsp;(Patrick Stewart)    
> <br/>	Death.
>
> **HUBERT** &nbsp;(David Suchet) 
> <br/>	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My Lord?
>
> **KING JOHN**     
> <br/>	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A grave.
>
> **HUBERT** 
> <br/>	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He shall not live.
>
> **KING JOHN**     
> <br/>	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Enough.
> <p align="right">[<em>Jn.</em> III.iii.66]


<br/> "WHEN, IN DISGRACE WITH FORTUNE AND MEN'S EYES"
: An outcast thinking of his beloved—how verses help phrase multi-line sentences:

> (Sheila Hancock)
> <br/>	When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,
> <br/>	I all alone beweep my outcast state,
> <br/>	And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
> <br/>	And look upon myself, and curse my fate,
> <br/>	Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
> <br/>	Featur’d like him, like him with friends possess’d,
> <br/>	Desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope,
> <br/>	With what I most enjoy contented least;
> <br/>	Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
> <br/>	Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
> <br/>	Like to the lark at break of day arising
> <br/>	From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven’s gate;
> <br/>	&nbsp; &nbsp; For thy sweet love remember’d such wealth brings
> <br/>	&nbsp; &nbsp; That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
> <p align="right">[Sonnet 29]
