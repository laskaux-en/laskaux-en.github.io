Often as climaxes in the plot, dozens of surgical scenes are featured in the 20 episodes of _The Knick_. Below is a list of the major operations with brief descriptions. Enclosed in the brackets are the participating surgeons, the first of whom leads the procedure. Chickering, by default, refers to Dr. Bertram "Bertie" Chickering, Jr.

**26&nbsp; RETINAL DETACHMENT REPAIR**&nbsp; [Thackery] <br/>
The previous fight left Edwards' retina almost separated from the rear wall of his left eye. An incision on the sclera is intended to release the subretinal fluid and thus have the retina in contact with the _choroid_. The operation, however, is terminated at its beginning due to Thackery's drug withdral and hallucinations.
&nbsp;(202) <br /><br />


**27&nbsp; HEPATIC CANCER SURGERY**&nbsp; [Gallinger and Edwards]  <br/>

**30&nbsp; TOPECTOMY**&nbsp; [Thackery] <br/>
Experimenting on Mr. Sidney Carton, who loses the top of his cranium but retains an intact brain, Thackery elicits the motional and emotional responses of the patient by stimulating selected points of his brain with electric currents. Furthermore, using a rheoscope, Thackery identifies a brain spot excited after injecting the patient with a dose of morphine. In a subsequent operation, Thackery surgically removes the "morphine region," but leaves Carton in a vegetative state.

After trying _RÃ¶ntgenotherapy_, Bertie and Edwards attempt an ionic surgery by passing electric currents through mercury-coated zinc needles inserted into the tumor.
