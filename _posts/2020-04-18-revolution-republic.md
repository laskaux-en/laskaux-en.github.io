#### October 1789 – April 1792: Invention of the Guillotine {#guillotine}

Under the title "July 1790," in the peaceful [Jardin des Tuileries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuileries_Garden) after the storms, we hear the musix box playing the [Overture]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlEAAe28WQ)) of _Le nozze di Figaro_, K. 492, a Mozart opera composed and premiered in 1786 based on the 1778 comedy _La Folle Journée, ou le Mariage de Figaro_ by Pierre Beaumarchais.

![Tuileries](/assets/img/revolution/tuileries.png)


Yet the short dialogue between Louis XVI and Dr. **Joseph Ignace Guillotin** (Jacques Ciron) is advanced for more than half a year. Paradoxically, the guillotine—the notorious decapitation machine and icon of terror—is a product of the humanistic motive of Guillotin back in October 1789.

> Guillotin's special object was to obtain the adoption of another innovation. Disgusted as he was at the sight of the gibbet, which exhibited a corpse for hours before the mob, he determined to substitute for all former modes a punishment by which suffering would be mitigated. He saw no better means for the furtherance of his object than decapitation. . . . But then the executioner's sword had often failed to accomplish its work; the hand was apt to tremble, and machinery only could give a guarantee of unswerving precision. Guillotin's purpose was, then, to discover the best decapitating machine; and although the search he undertook was novel work for a man who had hitherto endeavoured to save life rather than to devise means of destroying it, he pursued it with untiring zeal. . . .
>
>'In every case of capital punishment the mode of execution shall be the same. The criminal shall be decapitated by means of a mechanical contrivance.' 
>
> By a fortunate chance, Charles Henri Sanson (appears later) had become acquainted with a German engineer of the name of Schmidt. . . . One evening, after playing an air of _Iphigénie en Aulide_, Charles Henri spoke to his companion of his perplexity. Schmidt hesitated for a moment, and then traced a few rapid lines on a piece of paper, which he handed to my grandfather. It was the guillotine.
>
> It was thus that the guillotine came into the world, as it were, in the midst of a concert.
>
> Charles Henri Sanson informed Guillotin of the discovery. If the people gave the name of guillotine to the new instrument of execution—although, I need hardly repeat, the doctor was not the real inventor of it—it was simply a act of justice; for it was owing to his efforts that decapitation and the machine used for its infliction were adopted. 
>
> He described the new apparatus in the sitting of April 31, 1791. . . . The Assembly at length appointed Dr. Antoine Louis to enquire into the new mode of decapitation. 
> <p align="right">—<em>Memoirs of the Sansons, from Private Notes and Documents 1688–1847</em>, vol. 1 (1876)

The participation of Louis XVI in the modification of this machine can be found in the memoir of Charles-Henri Sanson, who later guillotined the King as well as Danton, Camille Desmoulins, and Robespierre.

> **Louis** was the King's physician, and his royal patron heard of the mission he had to discharge. The dexterity of this prince as a locksmith is well known. He wished to assist Louis, and to give his personal attention to a matter in which, he said, he was interested as as sovereign. The King and his physician expressed as desire to examine the plan of the machine proposed by Guillotin. The latter was therefore requested by Dr. Louis to come to the Tuileries . . .
>
>Guillotin showed Louis the plan of the machine drawn by Schmidt, to which my grandfather had added a few explanations. While Louis was examining it with great attention, a door was opened, and a new comer appeared in the closet. Dr. Louis, who was seated, immediately rose. The stranger looked coldly at Dr. Guillotin, who bowed; and abruptly addressing Louis, he said to him: 
>
>'Well, doctor, what do you think of it?'
>
>'It seems to me perfect,' answered the doctor; 'and fully justifies what M. Guillotin told me. You can judge for yourself.' And he handed the plan to the last comer, who looked at it, and then shook his head doubtfully.
>
> 'The knife has the shape of a crescent. Do you think a knife thus shaped would be suitable for all necks? There are some which it certainly could not cut.' . . .
>
>'This gentleman is quite right,' answered my grandfather; 'the knife is not what it should be.'
>
> The King smiled with an air of satisfaction, and taking a pen which lay on the table, he rectified the plan, and substituted an oblique line for the crescent. 
>
>'I may be mistaken, after all,' he added; 'the two shapes should be tried when the experiments are made.' 
> <p align="right">—<em>Memoirs of the Sansons</em>, vol. 1 (1876)

![Guillotine](/assets/img/revolution/guillotine.png)

This meeting allegedly happened on 2 March 1792. Five days later, the design was approved by the Legislative Assembly. The first experiments were carried out on 17 April 1792, whose results favored Louis's suggestion.

#### 2 July 1790: Mirabeau's rendezvous with the Queen {#mirabeau-queen}

The secret meeting of Mirabeau and Marie-Antoinette in the park of the [Château de Saint-Cloud](http://www.reconstruisonssaintcloud.fr/english.html) is substantiated:

>On July 2d, he went to stay, as he often did, with his niece, Madame d'Aragon, at Passy. Very early in the morning of the following day, he took a cabriolet, and with his nephew, young du Saillant, disguised and acting as a postilion, drove through the quiet summer lanes which then led from Passy to Saint-Cloud. At an unfrequented entrance to the park he left the cabriolet and his nephew: a door was mysteriously opened to admit him and closed again. 
>
>In a summer-house, in the highest part of the gardens of Saint-Cloud, Mirabeau met the Queen, alone.
>
>. . . One story has it (there are several differing versions) that when she first saw the man who she believed had "led a band of outlaws to assassinate" the royal family at Versailles, she drew back with "a movement of horror." That passed. . . . But he won her, as he won everybody.
>
> . . . She spoke afterwards of the deep impression he made upon her. He himself alluded to the interview with a profound feeling, and often to her grace, her dignity, and her charm. Before they parted, it is said that he raised her hand to his lips: "Madame, the monarchy is saved!" 
>
>What is certain, is that the interview left him with a yet more resolute determination to serve her: that he imbued her with his master idea, of making the National party the King's party, and that his influence upon her mind can be traced long after his death.
> <p align="right">—Stephen G. Tallentyre, <em>The Life of Mirabeau</em> (1912)

![Queen and Mirabeau](/assets/img/revolution/mirabeau.jpg)

The confidential letters mentioned in the dialogue refer to Mirabeau's _Notes to the Court_, which were conveyed by Auguste d’Arenberg, comte de La Marck. From June 1790 to March 1791, Mirabeau averaged two notes a week to the Court. Many were destroyed after Mirabeau's death and the insurrection of 10 August 1792. Only fifty of them still exist.

> In the afternoon M. Goguenot returned. He had 
still the seals of France about him, and he brought me a statement of all he had burnt. . . . The most voluminous was that from Mirabeau. It was tied up with a scheme for an escape, which he thought necessary. 
> <p align="right">—<em>Memoirs of Madame Campan</em>, vol. 2 (1909)

#### 14 July 1790: _Fête de la Fédération_ {#fete}

> The 14th of July approached: that day was regarded by the nation as the anniversary of its deliverance, and preparations were made to celebrate it with a solemnity calculated to elevate the souls of the citizens, and to strengthen the common bonds of union. A confederation of the whole kingdom was appointed to take place in the Champ de Mars; and there, in the open air, the deputies sent by the eighty-three departments, the national representatives, the Parisian guard, and the monarch, were to take the oath to the constitution. . . . The immense preparations were scarcely completed in time; all Paris had been engaged for several weeks in getting the arrangements ready by the 14th.  &nbsp;[FAM] 

During the construction scene involving Parisians from all occupations, the choir sings ["Ça ira"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu01gO3pi4), whose music is from the contredanse "Le carillon national" composed by Bécourt.

>Ah ! ça ira, ça ira, ça ira, <br/>
>Le peuple en ce jour sans cesse répète. <br/>
>Ah ! ça ira, ça ira, ça ira, <br/>
>Malgré les mutins tout réussira ! 

Camille and Lucile Desmoulins get engaged. This is however an anachronism: _in reality, M. and M<sup>me</sup> Duplessis did not sent their blessing until December 1790._ 

Another few "rearrangements": _Danton was elected as a member of the Provisional Commune of Paris in January 1790, but the No. 46 of Camille Desmoulins's_ Révolutions de France et de Brabant _was published on 5 October 1790—the first Anniversary of the October Days. Desmoulins's famous_ [Discours de la Lanterne aux Parisiens](https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Oeuvres_de_Camille_Desmoulins_-_Tome_2/Le_Discours_de_la_Lanterne)—_the defense of political violence that earned him the title "procureur-général de la lanterne"—was nonetheless published in September 1789._

![Barbant](/assets/img/revolution/barbant.png)

All of them are asynchronized with the preparation of _Fête de la Fédération_.

> The vast space of the Champ de Mars was inclosed by raised seats of turf, occupied by four hundred thousand spectators. An antique altar was erected in the middle; and around it, on a vast amphitheatre, were the king, his family, the assembly, and the corporation. . . .
>
>A profound silence now reigned in the vast inclosure, and Lafayette, appointed that day to the command in chief of all the national guards of the kingdom, advanced first to take the civic oath. Borne on the arms of grenadiers to the altar of the country, amidst the acclamations of the people, he exclaimed with a loud voice, in his own name, and that of the federates and troops: “We swear eternal fidelity to the nation, the law, and the king; to maintain to the utmost of our power the constitution decreed by the national assembly, and accepted by the king; and to remain united with every Frenchman by the indissoluble ties of fraternity.” Forthwith the firing of cannon, prolonged cries of “Vive la nation!” “Vive le roi!” and sounds of music, mingled in the air. The president of the national assembly took the same oath, and all the deputies repeated it with one voice. Then Louis XVI. rose and said: “I, king of the French, swear to employ all the power delegated to me by the constitutional act of the state, in maintaining the constitution decreed by the national assembly and accepted by me.” The queen, carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment, rose, lifted up the dauphin in her arms, and showing him to the people, exclaimed: “Behold my son, he unites with me in the same sentiments.” At that moment the banners were lowered, the acclamations of the people were heard, and the subjects believed in the sincerity of the monarch, the monarch in the affection of the subjects, and this happy day closed with a hymn of thanksgiving.  &nbsp;[FAM]

The ceremony concludes the events in the first year of the Revolution.

#### 31 August 1790: Nancy Mutiny {#nancy}

> The ‘liberty’ achieved in 1789 was thus a two-edged sword in its practical applications.
>
> National Guard units of ‘active’ citizens in every commune chose their leaders. However, while officer positions in the armed forces were opened to non-nobles, the Assembly stalled at applying popular sovereignty to their election. The army and navy were wracked by internal conflict between noble officers and soldiers over control of regimental funds and the role of the army in repressing civilian protests. There were serious rebellions in the fleets at Toulon in December 1789 and Brest in September 1790. A rebellion in the garrison at Nancy in August 1790 was bloodily repressed by the commander Bouillé, cousin of the commander-in-chief of the army, Lafayette. The Assembly endorsed Bouillé’s actions. &nbsp;[PM]

![Nancy](/assets/img/revolution/nancy.png)

The execution scene described in the film, where **François Claude Amour, marquis de Bouillé** (Jean Boissery) sends the signal to the soldiers of the Swiss Régiment de Castella and Régiment de Vigier, happen on 4 September, when 22 mutineers from the Swiss Régiment de Châteauvieux are hanged and their ringleader **André Soret** (Matthew Jocelyn) broken on the wheel. 

The scene was filmed in the [La cour des Offices](https://www.chateaudefontainebleau.fr/le-chateau-et-les-jardins-de-fontainebleau/a-la-decouverte-des-cours-et-jardins/#cour-des-offices) of the [Château de Fontainebleau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Fontainebleau).

#### 10 November 1790: Danton's oration at the Assembly {#danton}

> The affair at Nancy, which had aroused so many passions, was the thing which finally roused Parisian opinion . . . Paris is for the first time claiming to govern the councils of the kingdom.
>
> . . . Bailly was sent by the town to "present the Commune at the bar of the Assembly and demand the recall" of the Ministers of Justice, War, and the Interior—De Cicé, La Tour du Pin, and St. Priest.  
>
> Danton was taken out of the informal body to which he had acted as secretary, and asked to be the orator of the legal Commune. There followed on the 10th of November a very curious scene. 
> <p align="right">—Hilaire Belloc, <em>Danton: A Study</em> (1899)

The oration of Danton at the National Constituent Assembly in the Salle du Manège was documented, including the interruption by the abbé **Jean-Sifrein Maury** (Michel Galabru):

> **M. Danton.**&nbsp; Messieurs, l'Assemblée nationale a cru devoir décider qu'il n'y avait pas lieu à délibérer sur la proposition qui lui a été faite de déclarer au roi que ses ministres avaient perdu la confiance de la nation, l'Assemblée nationale, les amis de la liberté, la France entière . . .
>
> **M. l'abbé Maury.**&nbsp; Qui est-ce qui a dit cela ?
>
> **M. Danton.**&nbsp; La commune de Paris, plus à portée qu'aucune autre commune du royaume, d'apprécier la conduite des ministres . . .
>
> **M. l'abbé Maury.**&nbsp; Pourquoi cela ?
>
>**M. Danton.** . . . En conséquence de la dénonciation faite par la commune de Paris, contre MM. Champion, La Tour-du-Piu et Guignard, elle supplie l'Assemblée nationale :
>
>1° De déclarer au roi que ces mêmes ministres sont indignes de la confiance publique et de le prier de les renvoyer; . . .  
>
>[AP, Wednesday 10 November 1790]

![Danton](/assets/img/revolution/danton.jpg)

These impeachments proved succesful: Minister of War **Jean-Frédéric de La Tour du Pin Gouvernet** was dismissed on 16 November; so was Keeper of the Seals **Jérôme Champion de Cicé** on 21 November and Minister of Interior Affairs **François-Emmanuel Guignard, comte de Saint-Priest** in January 1791. In his address, Danton yet defended for **Armand Marc, comte de Montmorin Saint-Hérem** (Yvan Varco), Minister of Foreign Affairs and Chief Minister, who is essentially the agent of Mirabeau regarding government affairs. 

For the first time, we see the National Constituent Assembly convening in the [Salle du Manège](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salle_du_Man%C3%A8ge), its new location since 6 October 1789.

[#contents](#contents)<br/> <br/>


#### 28 December 1790: Marriage of Lucile and Camille Desmouslins {#marriage}

The couple wed at the [Church of Saint-Sulpice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Sulpice,_Paris), witnessed by Lucile's parents and Camille's political friends—Robespierre, **Jacques Pierre Brissot** (Jean-Pierre Stewart, in black vest), **Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve** (Daniel Briquet, in olive vest), etc. Lucile's garter is inscribed with "Unissons nous pour la vie."  

![Wedding](/assets/img/revolution/wedding.png)

> Those were blessed hours for the young couple, and days full of the profund joy, the bliss, at once sober and intoxicating of great happiness. They installed themselves in the same house with Danton, in the Cour du Commerce. Friendly letters, full of compliments and kind wishes, poured in upon them.
> <p align="right">—Jules Claretie, <em>Camille Desmoulins and His Wife: Passages from the History of the Dantonists</em> (1876)

It is therefore not unreasonable to place the Dantons among the wedding guests.

#### 2 April 1791: Death of Mirabeau {#mirabeau-death}

On 8 Feburary, Mirabeau met La Fayette for the last time discussing the salvation of the kingdom and her monarchy. _No record shows Danton was around his deathbed._ Mirabeau's decease accelerated the fall of the royalists in a more radical revolutionary age.

> A few days afterwards he terminated a life worn out by passions and by toil. His death . . . was considered a public calamity; all Paris attended his funeral; there was a general mourning throughout France, and his remains were deposited in the receptacle which had just been consecrated _aux grands hommes_, in the name of _la patrie reconnaissante_. No one succeeded him in power and popularity; and for a long time, in dif cult discussions, the eyes of the assembly would turn towards the seat from whence they had been accustomed to hear the commanding eloquence which terminated their debates. Mirabeau, after having assisted the revolution with his daring in seasons of trial, and with his powerful reasoning since its victory, died seasonably. He was revolving vast designs; he wished to strengthen the throne, and consolidate the revolution; two attempts extremely dif cult at such a time. It is to be feared that royalty, if he had made it independent, would have put down the revolution; or, if he had failed, that the revolution would have put down royalty. It is, perhaps, impossible to convert an ancient power into a new order; perhaps a revolution must be prolonged in order to become legitimate, and the throne, as it recovers, acquire the novelty of the other institutions.  &nbsp;[FAM]

#### April 1791: Resistance to the _Constitution civile du clergé_ {#clery}

On 12 July 1790, two days before the _Fête de la Fédération_, the National Constituent Assembly voted on the _Constitution civile du clergé_, which subordinated the French Catholic Church to this revolutionary nation.

> . . . Most contentious, however, was the issue of how the clergy were to be appointed in future. To the trenchant objections from clerical deputies in the Assembly that the hierarchy of the Church was based on the principle of divine authority and inspired appointment by superiors, deputies such as Treilhard retorted that this had resulted in nepotism. Only the people could choose their priests and bishops. . . .
>
>In the face of the opposition of most clerical deputies, but impelled by increasing impatience with the intransigence of most bishops, the Assembly sought to force the issue by requiring elections to be held on New Year’s Day 1791, with those elected to swear an oath of loyalty to the law, the nation and the king. . . .
>
> Ultimately, only a handful of bishops and perhaps half the parish clergy took this oath. A large number of the latter subsequently retracted when, in April 1791, the pope, also antagonized by the absorption of his lands in and around Avignon into the new nation, condemned the Civil Constitution and the Declaration of the Rights of Man as inimical to a Christian life. He counselled the clergy of France to regard the constitutional clergy as heretics. &nbsp;[PM]

This is the represented dilemma of Louis XVI and the envoy of Pope Pius VI, as well as the cause of the public violence on reactionary priests, in the midst of which we hear ["Ça ira"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81rBLK-PWHs) played on a pipe organ. 

>In Paris the Pope was burned in effigy and hostile crowds prevented refractory priests and their congregations from exercising the freedom of worship vouchsafed as one of the Rights of Man and the Citizen. . . . 
>
> The French Revolution had many turning-points; but the oath of the clergy was, if not the greatest, unquestionably one of them. It was certainly the Constituent Assembly’s most serious mistake. For the first time the revolutionaries forced fellow citizens to choose; to declare themselves publicly for or against the new order.  &nbsp;[WD]

Slightly earlier, we see a short scene in which Marat and his mistress and future wife **Simone Évrard** (Louise Boisvert) are printing the 16 April 1791 issue of _L'Ami du peuple_, which incites the popular anguish aginst the church. _However, the real issue number on that day is 431 rather than 118; it mentions no anti-clergy topic; and finally, 16 April 1791 is a Saturday, not Sunday._ 

![Ami](/assets/img/revolution/ami.png)

The modern address of Marat's printing house is 1 Cour du Commerce Saint-André.

#### 20–21 June 1791: Flight to Varennes {#varennes}

> The arrangements were made by the queen’s devoted admirer, the Swedish adventurer Count Axel von Fersen. Through him Bouillé was contacted: he promised to provide military escorts when the royal fugitives made the dash for Montmédy, close to the Luxembourg frontier. . . . On the night of 20 June they slipped out of the Tuileries, past guards which had been doubled at renewed rumours of just such an attempt. Despite delays, they got clean away.  &nbsp;[WD]

![Fersen](/assets/img/revolution/fersen.png)

On the carriage are the King, the Queen, the Dauphin, Madame Royale, Madame Élisabeth, and marquise de Tourzel.

> The royal family travelled all night without their flight being known at Paris. . . . at eight o'clock in the morning it was still undiscovered; but soon afterwards the news got wind, and circulated with rapidity. Lafayette called together his aides-de-camp, and ordered them to depart immediately, in pursuit of the fugitives . . . He took the responsibility of this order on himself, and affected to believe that the royal family had been carried off by the enemies of the public. The respectful presumption was adopted  by the assembly, and all authorities. 
> <p align="right">—Adolphe Thiers, <em>The History of the French Revolution</em> (1878)

However, later the same day, the royal family are recognized by **Jean-Baptiste Drouet** (Dominique Pinon) and stopped by **Jean-Baptiste Sauce** (Daniel Langlet), prosecutor of the commune of Varennes. 

> At the same time, however, all these troop movements had aroused suspicion at towns along the route, National Guards were called out, and at Sainte-Ménehould, on the evening of 21 June, the king was recognized. Drouet, the local postmaster whose claims to have made the identification launched him into a career in radical politics, made a dash to Varennes, the next town on the route. Here the party was stopped, the whole town turned out, and the troops waiting there could do nothing. On the morning of the twenty-second messengers arrived from Paris with orders to bring the would-be escapers back. &nbsp;[WD]

The National Guard officer galloping on the country road to Châlons is **Jean-Louis Romeuf** (François Levantal), later a general of the First French Empire. **Claude-Antoine-Gabriel, duc de Choiseul** (Jean Boissery, the rider), who commands the hussars of Régiment de Lauzun escorting the flight, is arrested in Varennes at the same time. The official resolution to this attempted escape was decreed one month later, consistent with La Fayette's "The King is abducted" statement earlier.

> Nevertheless, despite his humiliating capture and return, the Assembly on 15 July decreed that he had in fact been mentally ‘kidnapped’ and that the monarchist provisions of the Constitution of 1791 would stand.   &nbsp;[PM]

[#contents](#contents) <br/> <br/> 


#### 17 July 1791: Champ-de-Mars massacre {#champ-de-mars}

>The flight to Varennes was the Revolution’s second great turning-point. Like the oath of the clergy, it forced everybody to make choices that most would have preferred not to face. . . . The failure of the attempted escape postponed that danger—but demanded choices of a different order. The monarch had renounced the Revolution, and had explained why at great length in the proclamation he left behind. . . . How could such a man remain head of State? The blackest suspicions of the Parisian populace and radical leaders were confirmed. Republicans now came into the open. All over the capital symbols of royalty were attacked and defaced, and on 24 June the Cordeliers Club delivered a petition to the National Assembly to depose the king or consult the Nation on his fate in a referendum. A crowd of 30,000 escorted its presenters.
&nbsp;[WD]

The scene is changed to the Cordeliers Convent for the third time (after the dawns of the Bastille Day and the October Days). Marat is addressing to the raging crowds of the Club, now formally the Society of the Friends of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, founded on 27 April 1790.

> The decision (the renewed confidence in Louis XVI as the head of the executive power) led to a breach in the ranks of he democrats. A protest demonstration, called for in a petition drafted by the Cordeliers Club on 16 July, was approved by the Jacobin Club; but the same evening, on Robespierre's initiative, the Jacobins withdrew their support. The Cordeliers, now faced with alternative of cancelling the demonstration or of going ahead on their own, decided on the latter course. The result as the petition of 17 July, drafted by François Robert and couched in more radical terms: while not specifically demanding a Republic, it called on the Assembly ‘de convoquer un nonveau corps constituant pour procéder au remplacement et à l’organisation d’un nouveau pouvoir exécutif’. . . . societies and clubs were invited . . . to march to the Champ de Mars to hold a peaceful demonstration.
> <p align="right">—George F. E. Rudé, <em>The Crowd in the French Revolution</em> (1972)

![Danton and Robespierre](/assets/img/revolution/danton-robespierre1.png)


However, an incident led to Bailly's proclaimation of martial law and the subsequent massacre:

>Two Invalides, supposed to be spies, were massacred and their heads stuck on pikes. The insurrection became alarming. Lafayette again repaired to the Champ de Mars, at the head of twelve hundred of the national guard. Bailly accompanied him, and had the red banner unfurled. The crowd was then summoned to disperse in the name of the law; it refused to retire, and, contemning authority, shouted, “Down with the red flag!” and assailed the national guard with stones. Lafayette ordered his men to fire, but in the air. The crowd was not intimidated with this, and resumed the attack; compelled by the obstinacy of the insurgents, Lafayette then ordered another discharge, a real and effective one. The terri ed multitude  ed, leaving many dead on the  eld. The disturbances now ceased, order was restored; but blood had  own, and the people never forgave Bailly or Lafayette the cruel necessity to which the crowd had driven them. This was a regular combat, in which the republican party, not as yet sufficiently strong or established, was defeated by the constitutional monarchy party. The attempt of the Champ de Mars was the prelude of the popular movements which led to the 10th of August. &nbsp;[FAM]

_In the film, the order to fire is given by Bailly instead of La Fayette, which is perhaps its most crucial discrepancy with the true history._ But unarguably, the reputation of these two royalist leaders had never been restored among the populace afterwards.

> The violent affray that took place on the Champ de Mars in July 1791 marked an important stage in the struggle for power between consitutional monarchists (Feuillants) and Jacobins, between liberal _bourgeoisie_ and revolutionary democrats. In Paris it led directly to the eclipse of Bailly and Lafayette as the leaders of the city administration; . . . In terms of the social history of Paris the Champ de Mars affair both represented the first bloody clash within the Third Estate—the growing divisions within which have already been noted—and the culmination of several months of social upheaval and of revolutionary agitation at the end of which de democrats organized in the Jacobin and Cordeliers Clubs appear as the undisputed leaders of the Parisian _san-culottes_.

#### September 1791: First Constitution {#constitution}

The Champ-de-Mars massacre was followed by a series of prosecutions, from 23 July to 4 August, against radical democrats and their journals. Several revolutionists were forced in exile.

Danton and Marat take refuge in London, and later return to Paris in August 1791 and Feburary 1792, repectively. _Marat's dermatosis began no latter than 1790. The pain could be only relieved through extended bath. He personally attributed the disease to his figitive life in sewers and cellars, but the true cause remains obscure._

Camille Desmoulins's newspaper is suspended. He flees to Marseilles, and returns in September. Robespierre, however, stays in Paris. He moves into the house of **Maurice Duplay** (Jean Bouise) at 398 Rue Saint-Honoré near the Tuileries Palace, and has been residing there until his death in 1794.

The Constitution of 1791 was voted by the National Constituent Assembly on 3 September and promulgated by Louis on 14 September. Having officially adopted a consitutional monarchy, the Assembly proclaimed a general amnest. Political activities in Paris were revitalized.

Robespierre's mistake that Marat metions refers to the self-denying ordinance he promoted, that all deputies of the former Constituent Assembly were forbidden from joining the new Legislative Assembly convened on 1 October 1791. This, nevertheless, marginalized the framers of the Consitution after its adoptation and assisted the growing of counter-revolutionary groups in late 1791. The devision between the royalists and the revolutionists were further deepened.

#### December 1791 – January 1792: Debate on war {#war}

The scene is changed to the Club des Jacobins for the first time, with Jacques Pierre Brissot, on behalf of the Girondins, delivering a pro-war speech in answer to the gathering of Armée des émigrés after the _Declaration of Pillnitz_ (17 August 1791) by Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor, and Frederick William II, King of Prussia. 

> The ‘Brissotins’ argued that the Revolution would not be safe until this foreign threat was destroyed. A military strike at Austria and Prussia, which would be brief because of the welcome the commoners in those countries would give their liberated brothers, would expose internal counter-revolutionaries in the cauldron of armed conflict between old and new Europe. . . . By early in 1792, such was the combination of anxiety, exhilaration and fear pervading the Assembly that most deputies convinced themselves that the rulers of Austria and Prussia in particular were engaged in naked aggression towards the Revolution. They were encouraged in their optimism by the urgings of political refugees in Paris who had formed themselves into a force of fifty-four companies of volunteers ready to depart to liberate their homelands.  &nbsp;[PM]

"Vivre libre ou mourir"—the motto of the Jacobin Club—is inscribed below the constitution tablet.

In reponse to Brissot's speeches on 29 and 30 December, Robespierre addressed at the Jacobins Club on 2 and 11 January:

> La plus extravagante idée qui puisse naître dans la tête d'un politique est de croire qu'il suffise à un peuple d'entrer à main armée chez un peuple étranger, pour lui faire adopter ses lois et sa constitution. **Personne n'aime les missionnaires armés**; et le premier conseil que donnent la nature et la prudence, c'est de les repousser comme des ennemis. 
>
> [The most extravagant idea that can arise in the mind of a politician is the belief that a people need only make an armed incursion into the territory of a foreign people, to make it adopt its laws and its constitution. **No one likes armed missionaries**; and the first counsel given by nature and prudence is to repel them as enemies.]

#### 20 April 1792: Declaration of war on Austria {#austria}

> **Le Roi.**&nbsp; Vous venez, messieurs, d'entendre le résultat des négociations que j'ai suivies avec la cour de Vienne. Les conclusions du rapport ont été l'avis unanime des membres de mon conseil. Je les ai moi-même adoptées : elles sont conformes au-vœu que m'a manifesté plusieurs fois l'Assemblée Nationale, et aux sentiments que m'ont témoignés un grand nombre de citoyens des différentes parties du royaume. Tous préfèrent la guerre à voir plus longtemps la dignité du peuple français outragée, et la sûreté nationale menacée.

#### 29 April 1792: Battle of Marquain {#marquain}

>On the Frontiers, our Armies, be it treason or not, behave in the worst way. Troops badly commanded, shall we say? Or troops intrinsically bad? Unappointed, undisciplined, mutinous; that, in a thirty-years peace, have never seen fire ? In any case, Lafayette's and Rochambeau's little clutch, which they made at Austrian Flanders, has prospered as badly as clutch need do: soldiers starting at their own shadow; suddenly sheirking, '_On nous trahit,_' and flying off in wild panic, at or before the first shot; managing only to hang some two or three prisoners they had picked up, and massacre their own Commander, poor **Theobald Dillon**, driven into a granary by them in the Town of Lille. 
> <p align="right">—Thomas Carlyle, <em>The French Revolution: A History</em>, vol. 2 (1923)

The Austrian troop defeating the French at Marquain, Belgium are commanded by **Louis-François de Civalart** (Tomasz Bialkowski).

#### 20 June 1792: March of the _sans-culottes_ {#sans-culottes}

At the Cordeliers Club, Marat cries out again for "purging the world of liberty":

> What struck his contemporaries most, and what stands out in all his writings and his speeches, is his eternal call to massacre. On the day of the fall of the Bastille, he asked for give hundred heads. A year later, he demanded five or six hundred more, not for vengeance, but for national security. As time went on, he showed more avidity. In August, 1791, he wanted eight hundred gibbets towards the end of 1791, he insisted upon five thousand, six thousand, twenty thousand, "And," said he, "let us not hesitate for an instant." With the new year, his demands grew: he asked for seventy thousand! His bloodthirtiness grew with the misfortunes of the nation.
> <p align="right">—Henri Béraud, <em>Twelve portraits of the French Revolution</em> (1928)

A demonstration in the spirit of that at the Champ-de-Mars are led by **Antoine-Joseph Santerre** (Marc de Jonge) and Victor Amédée de La Fage, marquis de Saint-Huruge. In the film, Louis Legendre is portrayed as another leader.

>Accordingly, on the morning of 20 June between 10,000 and 20,000 armed demonstrators converged on the Tuileries from the east in menacing silence. The palace guards made no attempt to stop them as they dragged cannon up the grand staircase and made for the king’s apartments. Now they began to shout slogans, proclaiming that they were ‘sans culottes’, ordinary patriots without fine clothes, come to intimidate tyrants. They found the king alone, and for two hours filed past him uttering threats and demanding the ministers’ reinstatement. But now for the first time Louis XVI showed the unexpected courage which dignified the last months of his dismal life and reign. He refused to be intimidated. He proclaimed his loyalty to the constitution. He even borrowed one of the fashionable new caps of liberty and wearing it drank to the health of the nation. In the end Pétion arrived from the Hôtel de Ville and persuaded the demonstrators to go home, empty-handed.  &nbsp;[WD]

#### 11 July 1792: _La Patrie en danger_ {#danger}

>Citoyens, la patrie est en danger !
>
> « Que ceux qui vont obtenir l'honneur de marcher les premiers pour défendre ce qu'ils ont de plus cher, se souviennent toujours qu'ils sont Français et libres ; que leurs concitoyens maintiennent, dans leurs foyers, la sûreté des personnes et des propriétés ; que les magistrats au peuple veillent attentivement ; que tous, dans un courage calme, attribut de la véritable force, attendent, pour agir, le signal de la loi, et la patrie sera sauvée. » (_Applaudissements._)
>
>[AP, Wednesday 11 July 1792]

In early July, the pressure of the coalition of foreign European powers forced the Assembly to announce that "The country is in danger!"

>Jean Debry, in the name of the same commission, proposed that the assembly should secure the tranquillity of the people, now greatly disturbed, by declaring that when the crisis became imminent, the assembly would declare the country is in danger; and that it would then take measures for the public safety. . . . Vergniaud, in a speech which deeply moved the assembly, drew a vivid picture of all the perils to which the country was at that moment exposed. He said that it was in the name of the king that the emigrants were assembled, that the sovereigns of Europe had formed a coalition, that foreign armies were marching on our frontiers, and that internal disturbances were taking place. . . 
>
> . . . on the 5th July the assembly pronounced the solemn declaration: _Citizens, the country is in danger!_ All the civil authorities immediately established themselves _en surveillance permanente._ All citizens able to bear arms, and having already served in the national guard, were placed in active service; every one was obliged to make known what arms and ammunition he possessed; pikes were given to those who were unable to procure guns; battalions of volunteers were enrolled on the public squares, in the midst of which banners were placed, bearing the words—“Citizens, the country is in danger!”  &nbsp;[FAM]

![Vergniaud](/assets/img/revolution/vergniaud.png)

*In the film, the order of Brunswick Manifesto and* La Patrie en danger *is reversed. The speech of* **Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud** (Steve Gadler) *was even earlier—on 3 July.* 

On the same day as the official declaration, Robespierre delivered his _Aux Fédérés_ address at the Club des Jacobins, calling for the protection of their homeland. On 17 July, he presented the _Pétition des Fédérés_ to the Assembly. The speech described in the film probably refers to his _Réflexions sur la manière dont on fait la guerre_ published around the same time:

> C'est dans ces circonstances, que nos généraux abandonnent leurs camps; viennent à Paris intriguer au château des Thuileries; et dicter des lois, au sein de l'assemblée nationale. Ils nous apprennent à-la-fois, que nos ennemis extérieurs se rassemblent; et qu'avant de leur faire la guerre, il faut dompter nos ennemis intérieurs.

#### 25 July 1792: Brunswick Manifesto {#brunswick}

An excerpt of the original text of the manifesto issued from Coblenz by **Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand von Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel** (Hans Meyer), commander of the Austrian–Prussian army is read by its drafter Axel von Fersen:

> . . . s'il est fait la moindre violence, le moindre outrage à leurs Majestés, le roi, la reine et la famille royale, s'il n'est pas pourvu immédiatement à leur sûreté, à leur conservation et à leur liberté, elles en tireront une vengeance exemplaire et à jamais mémorable, en livrant la ville de Paris à une exécution militaire et à une subversion totale, et les révoltés coupables d'attentats aux supplices qu'ils auront mérités.

![Brunswick](/assets/img/revolution/brunswick.png)

Meanwhile, the whole France is motivated into the state of People's War. 

> On 5 July the Assembly reinforced this trend by elaborating a procedure for declaring the Country in Danger: as soon as this state was proclaimed, all government bodies were placed in permanent session and authorized to raise volunteers from their National Guard units to fight at the front along- side the line army. Less than a week later the decree was invoked. As a result, fédérés continued to pour into Paris long after 14 July on their way to the front. Marseilles’s volunteers did not arrive until 30 July, when they marched into the capital singing Rouget de Lisle’s battle hymn, and thereby gave it the name it has borne ever since. &nbsp;[WD]

This battle hymn is none other than _Chant de guerre pour l'armée du Rhin_, or [_La Marseillaise_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTWMTWT8nVo).

#### Insurrection of 10 August 1792 {#insurrection}

Robespierre, at his residence in Maurice Duplay's house, exchanges opinions on the ongoing politcal instability with Desmoulins and Danton, who is conspiring an armed insurrection against the royalists. Robespierre expresses his objection to dictatorship and his faith to the constitution, but conceives its implementation through a new "National Convention." **Éléonore Duplay** (Fabienne Tricottet)—Maurice's eldest daughter—quickly appears and serves tea.

This meeting is likely to be fictional, but it conveys the views of these revolutionary leaders at this time. Moreover, Duplay's house was indeed used as a meeting place for planning the insurrection of 10 August.

> It was now certain that the demonstration of June 20th would have a more violent sequel. Already at the Jacobins on July 15th Danton’s bitter young secretary, the ex-Oratorian teacher, dramatist, and pamphleteer, Billaud-Varenne, had outlined a programme for the next insurrection. Exile the king, he had said: dismiss the generals; elect a National Convention; transfer the royal veto to the people; appoint a new Civil Service; arrest Luckner and Lafayette; deport all public enemies; exempt the poor from taxation. This programme was repeated almost intact in a strongly worded manifesto drawn up by Robespierre, and declaimed by a federal orator at the bar of the House. . . .
>
>Already (July 15th) a co-ordinating committee had been formed of one federal from each department. Within this body soon appeared a secret committee of five members. Vaugeois of Blois, Debesse of the Drôme, Guillaume of Caen, and Simon of Strasbourg were names as little known in Paris as they are to history; but they were the authors of a movement that shook France. They met at Duplay’s house in the rue Saint-Honoré, where Robespierre had his lodgings, in a room occupied by their fifth member, Antoine, the mayor of Metz, during his visits to Paris.
> <p align="right">—J. M. Thompson, <em>The French Revolution</em> (1944)

Meanwhile, Danton succeeds in transferring the _fédérés_ from Marseilles into an insurgent troop.

> President Danton, in the Cordeliers Section, does another
thing: invites all Passive Citizens to take place among the
Active in Section-business, one peril threatening all. Thus he, though an official person; cloudy Atlas of the whole. Likewise he manages to have that blackbrowed Battalion of Marseillese shifted to new Barracks, in his own region of the remote Southeast.
> <p align="right">—Thomas Carlyle, <em>The French Revolution: A History</em>, vol. 2 (1923)

The night before the rebellion is painted with some humanistic color:

> The outcome was never really in doubt. But as the tocsin rang through the night of the ninth-tenth of August, many of the men who made their way towards the Hôtel de Ville were apprehensive. After dinner Camille Desmoulins and his wife had gone to Danton’s apartment to try to stiffen their morale but had found Danton’s wife Gabrielle in floods of tears. Lucile, who remembered herself “laughing like a madwoman,” took Danton’s wife for some air in the street and found a great crowd in the apartment when they got back, everyone trying to outdo each other with grandiloquent utterances that seemed appropriate to their overwrought sense of historymaking. But beneath the oracular declarations, agitation and fear put everyone on edge. When Camille set off into the night, carrying a musket and promising his wife to stay with the reassuringly enormous figure of Danton, she too began to weep passionately.
> <p align="right">—Simon Schama, <em>Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution</em> (1989)

These weeping scenes were recorded in the diary of Lucile Desmoulins.

>After all, these pages from the young wife's diary, showing a great episode of history from the point of view of the women who waited to hear the upshot of the fight, is of greater interest than any cut-and-dried description. It is so plain throughout that, for the moment, Lucile Desmouhns, Gabrielle Danton and Madame Robert cared very little what was to be the issue of the day. What mattered it if their cause was won, if it meant the loss of their husbands ? 
 > <p align="right">—Violet Methley, <em>Camille Desmoulins: A Biography</em> (1914)


The Hôtel de Ville chaired by **Jacques Antoine Joseph Cousin** (Sady Rebbot) is invaded first. An "Insurrectionary Commune" is founded by insurgent leaders including Danton, **Jacques-René Hébert** (Georges Corraface), and **Jean-Lambert Tallien**.

> Control of the Hôtel de Ville was essential for the success
of insurrection. Once in control of the municipal authority, the revolutionists could depose Mandat, assume control of the National Guard, and deprive the Tuileries of the greater part of its defenders. By eleven o'clock the commissioners of the sections had begun to gather at the Hôtel de Ville. The council general of the commune then in session was following the progress of events with increasing anxiety. In the absence of Pétion, the mayor, who had gone to the Tuileries, its chairman was Cousin, a professor at the College de France. It endured the taunts and abuse of the public in the galleries. It vainly sent municipal officers to prevent the ringing of the tocsin. But on their return they reported evidence of reluctance and hesitation in the revolutionry movement.
>
> Danton himself, as substitute for the procureur général,
is said to have given the signal to the bell-ringers and at a
quarter before twelve the mournful notes of the great bell of the Cordeliers with that of Saint-André-des-Arcs fell on the
ears of the expectant city. . . .
>
>By three o'clock in the morning nineteen sections were represented by their commissioners at the Hôtel de Ville. By seven there were eighty-four commissioners, represent ing twenty-eight sections. They called themselves “the new commune” and installed themselves in a hall adjoining the one in which the council general was still sitting.
> <p align="right">—George H. Allen, <em>The French Revolution</em>, vol. 2 (1923)

**Antoine Galiot Mandat de Grancey** (mentioned), commander-in-chief of the Garde nationale, is murdered by the insurgents at the Hôtel de Ville. At dawn, convinced by 
**Pierre-Louis Rœderer** (Jerry Di Giacomo), procureur général of the départment of Paris,  the royal family decide to take refuge in the National Assembly, which is in permant session.

> While all this was passing at the Tuileries, the insurgents were advancing in several columns; they had passed the night in assembling, and becoming organized. . . . At this moment Roederer arrived, and increased the alarm of the court by announcing that the danger was extreme; that the insurgents would not be treated with, and that the national guard could not be depended upon. “Sire,” said he, urgently, “your majesty has not five minutes to lose: your only safety is in the national assembly; it is the opinion of the department that you ought to repair thither without delay. There are not sufficient men in the court to defend the chateau; nor are we sure of them.” . . . at the renewed urgency of Roederer, the king after looking at him attentively for a few minutes, turned to the queen, and said, as he rose: “Let us go.” “Monsieur Roederer,” said Madame Elizabeth, addressing the recorder, “you answer for the life of the king?” “Yes, madame, with my own,” he replied. “I will walk immediately before him.”
>
> Louis XVI. left his chamber with his family, ministers, and the members of the department, and announced to the persons assembled for the defence of the chateau that he was going to the national assembly. He placed himself between two ranks of national guards, summoned to escort him, and crossed the apartments and garden of the Tuileries. A deputation of the assembly, apprised of his approach, came to meet him: “Sire,” said the president of this deputation, “the assembly, eager to provide for your safety, offers you and your family an asylum in its bosom.” The procession resumed its march, and had some difficulty in crossing the terrace of the Tuileries, which was crowded with an animated mob, breathing forth threats and insults. The king and his family had great dif culty in reaching the hall of the assembly, where they took the seats reserved for the ministers. “Gentlemen,” said the king, “I come here to avoid a great crime; I think I cannot be safer than with you.” “Sire,” replied Vergniaud, who filled the chair, “you may rely on the firmness of the national assembly. Its members have sworn to die in maintaining the rights of the people, and the constituted authorities.” The king then took his seat next the president. But Chabot reminded him that the assembly could not deliberate in the presence of the king, and Louis XVI. retired with his family and ministers into the reporter’s box behind the president, whence all that took place could be seen and heard.  &nbsp;[FAM]

At the Salle du Manège, Vergniaud welcomes the King and assures him of the safety of the royal family. 

>**Le Roi.**&nbsp; Je suis venu ici pour éviter un grand crime, et je me croirai toujours en sûreté avec ma famille, au milieu des représentants de la nation. (_Applaudissements._) 
>
>J'y passerai la journée. (_Applaudissements._)
>
>**M. le Président** (Vergniaud).&nbsp; L'Assemblée nationale connaît tous ses devoirs. Elle regarde comme un des plus chers le maintien de toutes les autorités constituées.

![Assembly](/assets/img/revolution/assembly.jpg)

Back at Tuileries, nine hundred Swiss Guards, commanded by **Karl Josef von Bachmann** (Jean-Pierre Delamour), defend the empty palace with their lives. 

> Nevertheless it was the Swiss who opened fire, and that sealed their fate when the commune’s forces gained the upper hand after about an hour. Once the Swiss began to retreat, they were pursued by mobs of bystanders without firearms who hacked them to death with knives, pikes, and hatchets, and tore their uniforms to pieces to make trophies. Altogether 600 of them perished, some in supposed safe custody after the siege was over. Less than half that number fell among the besiegers, 90 of them fédérés, and the rest the same sort of shopkeepers, petty tradesmen, and artisans who had been so prominent in the 1789 journées and on 20 June. It was the bloodiest day of the Revolution so far, but also one of the most decisive. Though the king and his family remained unscathed, his authority fell with his palace. As crowds rampaged through Paris destroying all symbols and images of royalty down to the very word ‘king’ in street names, the Legislative Assembly declared the monarchy suspended until a national Convention had met to decide on the future form of government. &nbsp;[WD]

![Tuileries](/assets/img/revolution/tuileries.jpg)

> Finally, the 23rd of September was appointed for opening the extraordinary assembly, destined to decide the fate of royalty. But royalty had already fallen on the 10th of August, that day marked by the insurrection of the multitude against the middle classes and the constitutional throne, as the 14th of July had seen the insurrection of the middle class against the privileged class and the absolute power of the crown. On the 10th of August began the dictatorial and arbitrary epoch of the revolution. Circumstances becoming more and more difficult to encounter, a vast warfare arose, requiring still greater energy than ever, and that energy irregular, because popular, rendered the domination of the lower class restless, cruel, and oppressive.   &nbsp;[FAM]
