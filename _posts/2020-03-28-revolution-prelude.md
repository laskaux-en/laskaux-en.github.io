## Part One: _Les Années lumière_

The first part of this grand historical film reenacts the last years of the Ancien Régime—from the convocation of the Estates-General of 1789 to the Insurrection of 10 August 1792. 

Prior to its grand opening sequence featuring the Grand Canal and the Bassin de Latone in the Gardens of Versailles, the films nonetheless begins with a pre-edit scene back to 1775, when the 17-year-old **Maximilien de Robespierre** (Steve Carretero) delivers a Latin tribute to the newly crowned Louis XVI on behalf of his classmates at the Collège Louis-le-Grand, among whom stands the 15-year-old **Camille Desmoulins** (Philip-James Valentini). 

This anecdote was noted down by the abbé Liévin-Bonaventure Proyart, then Robespierre's teacher at Louis-le-Grand and later his biographer:

>En 1775, Louis XVI, après la cérémonie de son sacre, fit son entrée solennelle dans Paris, accompagné de la reine et de la famille royale. Leurs majestés . . . s’arrêtèrent devant le collége de Louis-le-Grand, où elles furent complimentées par l'Université en corps. . . . et ce fut Robespierre que l'on chargea de le lui offrir au nom de ses condisciples, dans un discours en vers qu’avait composé son professeur. Le roi abaissa un regard de bonté sur ce jeune homme qui, élevé dans sa maison, devait un jour lui porter le premier coup de poignard. <br />
 > <p align="right">—Proyart, <em>La Vie de Maximilien de Robespierre</em> (1850)

_Nevertheless, the record of this fateful encounter is generally considered unsubstantiated. Leastwise, it could not happen in 1774 according to the caption, as Louis XVI was crowned in Reims Cathedral on 11 June 1775._ <br /><br />


#### Royal family in 1788

In the opulent royal ball hosted in the Galerie des Glaces (Hall of Mirrors) of the Palace of Versailles, **Louis XVI** (Jean-François Balmer) and **Marie-Antoinette d'Autriche** (Jane Seymour, VF: Béatrice Delfe) make their first appearances. "Madame Déficit" is accompanied by her dancing partner **Axel von Fersen** (Jean-Yves Berteloot), her superintendent **Marie-Thérèse-Louise de Savoie-Carignan, princesse de Lamballe** (Gabrielle Lazure), and her favorite **Gabrielle de Polastron, duchesse de Polignac** (Claudia Cardinale). Polignac sits closer to the Queen at the casino table, reflecting Lamballe's gradual falling out of favor since 1785.

Shortly afterwards, three royal childern appear at the Hameau de la Reine in the Petit Trianon of Versailles: Dauphin of France **Louis-Joseph** (Benji Marcus) riding a pony, his elder sister **Marie-Thérèse Charlotte**, or **Madame Royale** (Katherine Flynn), and their younger brother **Louis-Charles**, the future **Louis XVII** (Sean Flynn). Katherine and Sean are Seymour's daughter and son in real life. <br /><br />


#### 21 January 1789: Summoning the Estates-General

In the film, **Jacques Necker** (Raymond Gérôme), the esteemed Controller-General of Finances and Chief Minister of France, advices Louis XVI to summon the Estates-General in order to levy taxes to address the state deficit. _This decision-making process was, however, much more tortuous in history, where the idea of restoring this legislative and consultative assembly after more than 170 years was first deliberated on the Assembly of Notables in 1787._

>‘It seems to me’, declared Lafayette in the bureau where he sat on 21 May, ‘that this is the moment for us to beseech His Majesty to fix, immediately, in order to render account to him of all measures and settle their happy outcome forever, the convocation of a truly national assembly.’ ‘What, Sir,’ burst out the Count d’Artois, the king’s brother, ‘are you calling for the Estates-General?’ ‘Yes, my lord,’ replied the young glory-hunter, ‘and even better than that.’ &nbsp;[WD]

_The date of the Estates-General was officially announced by the previous finance minister Étienne-Charles de Loménie de Brienne on 8 August 1788, before Necker's return to office on 24 August. A royal edict_—Règlement des États généraux de 1789*—was issued on 24 January, followed by the nationwide elections of the delegates from the three estates of realm.* <br /><br />


#### March–April 1789: Elections

On 4 March 1789, inside a church in Guise, **Camille Desmoulins** (François Cluzet) plans to run for Estates-General deputy, together with his father **Jean-Benoist-Nicolas Desmoulins** (Jean-Marie Bernicat). Subsequently, Camille is compiling a Third-Estate _cahier de doléances_—a list of grievances raised by commoners, mainly against the privileges of the First and Second Estates. Camille unfortunately fails the election. _Omitted in the film, Jean-Benoist-Nicolas was nominated, but declined due to health reasons._

The disappointed Camille moves back to Paris. Walking down the Rue des Cordeliers (nowadays Rue de l'École-de-Médecine), he meets **Antoine Simon** (Alain Frérot) the shoemaker, and **Louis Legendre** (Jean-François Stévenin) the butcher, both politicians-to-be. Seconds later, he greets his future wife **Lucile Desmoulins** (Marie Bunel) and in-laws **Claude-Étienne Laridon-Duplessis** (François Lalande) and **Anne-Françoise-Marie Bois de Veix** (Geneviève Mnich). Apparently, M. Duplessis is not very fond of Camille at this moment.

>. . . although Camille's love for Lucile Duplessis grew with each meeting, his suit appeared too hopeless to be even hinted at to the girl's parents. M. Duplessis would simply have laughed at him; Madame Duplessis might have been kinder, but she most certainly would not have consented to think of the young man as her daughter's lover, desperately poor and desperately unsuccessful as he still was. <br />
 > <p align="right">—Violet Methley, <em>Camille Desmoulins: A Biography</em> (1914)

A few key figures during the coming Revolution are introduced next: 

In a Parisian bar, the wealthy lawyer **Georges Jacques Danton** (Klaus Maria Brandauer, VF: Bernard Murat), reluctant to enter politics, chats with the influential **Honoré-Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau** (Peter Ustinov, VF: Roger Carel), who, despite his noble status, is going to represent the Third Estate. **Jean-Paul Marat** (Vittorio Mezzogiorno, VF: Michel Vigné), physician and scientist, has undertaken political writings, _whose_ Offrande à la Patrie _was published earlier that year._   

_It is not evident how the trajectories of Mirabeau, Danton, Desmoulins, Simon, Legendre, and Marat intersected in early 1789._ Besides delineating the personal histories and dispositions of these characters, these scenes set up the community background of the future Club des Cordeliers.

While Mirabeau never conceals his passion for a colorful private life, Danton is known to be loyal to his wife **Antoinette Gabrielle Danton** (Marianne Basler), who, in the film, is carrying their future son Antoine. _However, Gabrielle's pregnancy as depicted seems not synchronized with Antoine's birth in June 1790._ <br /><br />


#### 5 May 1789: Opening of the Estates-General

This historic convention opens in the magnificent Hôtel des Menus-Plaisirs in Versailles. 

>The royal session took place the following day in the Salle des Menus Galleries, arranged in the form of an amphitheatre, were filled with spectators. The deputies were summoned and introduced according to the order established in 1614. The clergy were conducted to the right, the nobility to the left, and the commons in front of the throne at the end of the hall. &nbsp;[FAM]

![Estate-general](/assets/img/revolution/estate-general.jpg)

_Among the 1139 delegates were 291 clergmen, 270 nobles, and 578 commoners._ As depicted in the film, Louis XVI delivers a short opening speech, whose text is modified from the documentation:

>**Sa Majesté.** . . . Puisse, Messieurs, un heureux accord régner dans cette Assemblée, et cette époque devenir à jamais mémorable pour le bonheur et la prospérité du royaume ! c'est le souhait de mon cœur, c'est le plus ardent de mes vœux, c'est enfin le prix que j'attends de la droiture de mes intentions et de mon amour pour mes peuples. Puisse, Messieurs, un heureux accord régner dans cette Assemblée, et cette époque devenir à jamais mémorable pour le bonheur et la prospérité du royaume ! c'est le souhait de mon cœur, c'est le plus ardent de mes vœux, c'est enfin le prix que j'attends de la droiture de mes intentions et de mon amour pour mes peuples.  
>
>[AP, Tuesday 5 May 1789]

Nicker addresses to the assembly for three hours regarding the financial situation.

More notable figures show up in this reenactment: 

Sitting on the left-hand side of the Queen is **Charles-Philippe, comte d'Artois**, the youngest brother of Louis XVI and the future **Charles X** (André Penvern).

In the front row of nobility, we see **Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette** (Sam Neill, VF: Pierre Arditi). Even the 7-year-old Dauphin knows he is the hero of the American Independence War. 

Among the clergy is the abbé **Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès** (Jean Bouchaud), political theorist and the author of _Qu'est-ce que le Tiers-État ?_ [_What Is the Third Estate?_]

Camille Desmoulins, attending the convention as a spectator, greets his old classmate **Maximilien de Robespierre** (Andrzej Seweryn), a Third-Estate deputy for Arras.  

After the session, Desmoulins reunites with Robespierre at the latter's place. On the table lays a copy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, _Du contrat social; ou, Principes du droit politique_ (first edition printed in 1762). They recollect the words of an old lecturer at Louis-le-Grand, which are resonant with the core questions in the abbé Sieyès's _Qu'est-ce que le Tiers-État ?_ (1789):

>1º Qu’est-ce que le Tiers-État ? Tout. <br />
>2º Qu’a-t-il été jusqu’à présent dans l’ordre politique ? Rien. <br />
>3º Que demande-t-il ? À y devenir quelque chose. 
>
>[1. What is the Third Estate? Everything;&nbsp; 2. What has it been hitherto in the political order? Nothing;&nbsp; 3. What does it desire to be? To become something.]


#### <br /> 20 June 1789: Tennis Court Oath

On June 4 1789, Louis-Joseph, Dauphin of France, dies at age seven of tuberculosis. Meanwhile, the tension between the estates in the convention ramps up.

> The immediate issue was that of voting procedures: while the Third Estate deputies refused to vote separately, the nobility was in favour (by 188 votes to 46) as, very narrowly, were the clergy (134 votes to 114). Ultimately, Louis’s acquiescence in the nobility’s demand for voting to be in three separate chambers galvanized the outrage of the bourgeois deputies. &nbsp;[PM]

A series of following events lead to the formation of the _Assemblée nationale_ on 17 June.

> By the second week of the month (June) third-estate patience was running out. Against their previous resolutions, they had already begun to organize themselves and establish procedures, and on 3 June they elected Bailly as their president. There was now constant talk of unilateral action, of declaring the ‘Commons’ to be the national assembly, and of proceeding to verification of powers on that basis without further reference to the other two orders. On 10 June this talk at last culminated in a formal motion, moved by Sieyès, that a final appeal should be sent to the other two orders to join at once in common verification. Failing that, the Commons would proceed anyway. . . . It all played into Sieyès’s hands, and by the seventeenth he felt able to propose the title he had always wanted. By then an overwhelming majority recognized that there was no sensible alternative, and the name National Assembly was adopted by 491 votes to 89. &nbsp;[WD]

Its first president, **Jean Sylvain Bailly** (Michel Duchaussoy), astronomer and member of the Académie des sciences and the Académie française, presides over the solemn _serment du Jeu de Paume_ on 20 June.

>It was feared that the majority of the clergy would recognise the assembly by uniting with it; and to prevent so decided a step, instead of hastening the royal sitting, they closed the Salle des Etats, in order to suspend the assembly till the day of the sitting. . . . At that time Bailly presided over the assembly. . . . At an appointed hour on the following day, he repaired to the Salle des Etats, and finding an armed force in possession, he protested against this act of despotism. In the meantime the deputies arrived, dissatisfaction increased, all seemed disposed to brave the perils of a sitting. . . . one named the Tennis-court; this proposition was well received, and the deputies repaired thither in procession. Bailly was at their head; the people followed them with enthusiasm; even soldiers volunteered to escort them, and there, in a bare hall, the deputies of the commons standing with upraised hands, and hearts full of their sacred mission, swore, with only one exception, not to separate till they had given France a constitution. &nbsp;[FAM]

![Tennis Court Oath](/assets/img/revolution/tennis-court.jpg)

The Oath can be found in _Gazette nationale ou le Moniteur universel_, the official newspaper during the Revolution:

> « Nous jurons de ne jamais nous séparer de l'Assemblée nationale, et de nous réunir partout où les circonstances l’exigeraient, jusqu’à ce que la Constitution du royaume fût établie et affermie par des fondements solides. »
>
>["We swear never to separate from the National Assembly and to meet wherever circumstances require until the kingdom’s Constitution is established and grounded on solid foundations."]




#### <br /> 23 June 1789: _Séance royale_

This dramatic royal session is centered around the conflict between the privileged and the reformers, starting from the King's declarations nullifying the decisions of the National Assembly:

>**Sa Majesté.** . . . Réfléchissez, Messieurs, qu'aucun de vos projets, aucune de vos dispositions ne peut avoir force de loi sans mon approbation spéciale. Ainsi, je suis le garant naturel de vos droits respectifs ; et tous les ordres de l'Etat peuvent se reposer sur mon équitable impartialité.
>
>Toute défiance de votre part serait une grande injustice. C'est moi, jusqu'à présent, qui fais tout le bonheur de mes peuples ; et il est rare peut-être que l'unique ambition d'un souverain soit d'obtenir de ses sujets qu'ils s'entendent enfin pour accepter ses bienfaits.
>
>Je vous ordonne, Messieurs, de vous séparer tout de suite, et de vous rendre demain matin chacun dans les Chambres affectées à votre ordre, pour y reprendre vos séances. . . . 
>
>[AP, Tuesday 23 June 1789]

The subsequent confrontation is recorded by multiple sources. As recalled by its main participant,

> Le grand-maître des cérémonies s'approcha de moi, et me dit : Monsieur, vous avez entendu l'ordre du roi ? Je lui répondit : . . . Je crois que la nation assemblée ne peut pas recevoir d'ordre. . . . À la vérité, Mirabeau prit la parole et, s'emportant contre le grand-maître des cérémonies, dit à-peu-près ce qu'on a répété depuis : « Allez dire à ceux qui vous envoient que la force desbaïonnettes ne peut rien contre la volonté de la nation : » on a beaucoup loué cette réponse, . . . <br />
> <p align="right">—Bailly, <em>Mémoires d'un témoin de la Révolution</em>, Tome 1<sup>er</sup> (1804)

A better-known version of Mirabeau's defiance of the Grand Master of Ceremonies—**Henri Evrard, marquis de Dreux-Brézé** (Sebastian Roché)—is found in Adolphe Thiers's _Histoire de la Révolution française_, Tome 1<sup>er</sup> (1823):

> « Allez dire à votre maître que nous sommes ici par la puissance du peuple, et qu'on ne nous en arrachera que
par la puissance des baïonnettes. »
>
>["Go and tell your master that we are here by the power of the people, and that nothing bu the power of bayonets shall drive us away."]

A prominent figurant: Nicolas Sarkozy as the Third-Estate deputy second to the left of Mirabeau. <br /><br />


#### 12–13 July 1789: Riots in Paris 

> In these circumstances he (Louis XVI) made the final surrender. On 27 June he wrote to the presidents of the clerical and noble orders ordering them to join the National Assembly. 
>
>. . . Responsible men now looked forward to a period of dignified calm, allowing a return to normality and social harmony. Yet as July began there was little sign of that. On 26 June four regiments were ordered from the frontiers to the Paris region, and around the same time the king asked the veteran Marshal de Broglie to assume supreme command. On 1 July more troops were ordered up, making a fivefold increase, to well over 20,000, in less than a week. Nobody could fail to notice the build-up, or the number of foreign regiments involved, presumed to be more reliable than French ones. . . . At Court, the queen and Artois remained determined to get rid of Necker. . . . By 11 July they thought they had found them. That afternoon, the minister was presented with a royal letter dismissing him and ordering him to leave the country immediately.  &nbsp;[WD]

Counteractions of the royal court include the dismissal of Necker and the military deterrent. Marching in the film are three infantry and one calvary troops. Judging by their uniforms, they are likely to be (in the order of appearance): the Swiss Régiment de Castellas, the French Régiment du Dauphin dragons, the French Régiment de Provence, and the Swiss Régiment de Salis-Samade.

> On the following day, Sunday, the 12th of July, about four in the afternoon, Necker’s disgrace and departure became known at Paris. . . . In a short time the city was in the greatest confusion; crowds gathered together on every side; more than ten thousand persons flocked to the Palais Royal all affected by this news, ready for anything, but not knowing what measure to adopt. Camille Desmoulins, a young man, more daring than the rest, one of the usual orators of the crowd, mounted on a table, pistol in hand, exclaiming: “Citizens, there is no time to lose; the dismissal of Necker is the knell of a Saint Bartholomew for patriots! This very night all the Swiss and German battalions will leave the Champ de Mars to massacre us all; one resource is left; to take arms!” These words were received with violent acclamations. He proposed that cockades should be worn for mutual recognition and protection. “Shall they be green,” he cried, “the colour of hope; or red, the colour of the free order of Cincinnatus?” “Green! green!” shouted the multitude. The speaker descended from the table, and fastened the sprig of a tree in his hat. Every one imitated him. The chestnut-trees of the palace were almost stripped of their leaves . . . &nbsp;[FAM]

![Cafe de Foy](/assets/img/revolution/desmoulins.jpg)

This inspiring speech at the Café de Foy near the Galerie de Montpensier in the Palais-Royal is vividly reenacted in the film. So is the attack on the multitude in the Tuileries Garden by the German Régiment Royal-Allemand cavalerie commanded by **Charles Eugène de Lorraine, prince de Lambesc** (Mario Luraschi). 

In the meantime, Danton launches his political career by orating at the Club des Cordeliers, _although its synchronization with the Parisian insurrections is probably fictional._ Among the enthusiastic crowd are Marat, Legendre, Simon, and the Saint-Domingue distiller **Claude Fournier l'Américain** (Georges Trillat). <br /><br />


#### 14 July 1789: Storming of the Bastille

The Bastille, demolished in late 1789, is "reconstructed" using the Château de Tarascon in Bouches-du-Rhône. Most narrative of this siege and sieze is historically accurate.

![Bastille](/assets/img/revolution/bastille.jpg)

The commanders of defense are **Bernard René Jourdan, marquis de Launay** (Henri Serre), governor of the Bastille, and Lieutenant **Ludwig von Flüe/Louis de Flue** (Philippe Chemin), commanding officer of the Swiss Guards from the Régiment de Salis-Samade. On the side of besiegers are **Stanislas-Marie Maillard** (Patrick Tessari), the "capitaine des volontaires de la Bastille," who stands on a plank over the moat to get the letter from de Launay, and **Pierre-Augustin Hulin** (Bernard Lepinaux), who leads one of the two mutinous columns of Gardes Françaises. **Jacques-Alexis Thuriot de la Rosière** (Michel Melki) serves as the negotiator between the two sides.

> On the 13th the insurrection took at Paris a more regular character. . . .  A permanent committee was formed at the Hotel de Ville, to take measures for the general safety.
>
> The next day . . . an alarm was given that the regiments stationed at Saint Denis were on the march, and that the cannon of the Bastille were pointed on the Rue Saint Antoine. The committee immediately sent to ascertain the truth; appointed bands of citizens to defend that side of the town, and sent a deputation to the governor of the Bastille, soliciting him to withdraw his cannon and engage in no act of hostility. . . .
>
> A deputy of the district of Saint Louis de la Culture, named Thuriot de la Rosiere, then requested a parley with De Launay, the governor. When admitted to his presence he summoned him to change the direction of the cannon. The governor replied, that the cannon had always been placed on the towers, and it was not in his power to remove them; yet, at the same time, having heard of the alarm prevalent among the Parisians, he had had them withdrawn a few paces, and taken out of the port-holes. . . .
>
>But the impatient crowd now clamoured for the surrender of the Bastille. From time to time the cry arose, “The Bastille! we will have the Bastille!” At length, two men, more determined than the rest, darting from the crowd, sprang on a guardhouse, and struck at the chains of the drawbridge with heavy hatchets. The soldiers shouted to them to retire, and threatened to  re; but they continued to strike, succeeded in breaking the chains and lowering the bridge, and then rushed over it, followed by the crowd. In this way they advanced to cut the chains of the second bridge. The garrison now dispersed them with a discharge of musketry. . . .
>
> The siege had lasted more than four hours when the French guards arrived with cannon. Their arrival changed the appearance of the combat. The garrison itself begged the governor to yield. The unfortunate De Launay, dreading the fate that awaited him, wished to blow up the fortress, and bury himself under its ruins and those of the faubourg. He went in despair towards the powder magazine, with a lighted match. The garrison stopped him, raised a white standard on the platform, and reversed the guns, in token of peace. . . . The governor, a few Swiss soldiers and Invalides were torn from the protection of those who sought to defend them, and put to death by the implacable crowd. &nbsp;[FAM]

More details can be found in Jacques Léon Godechot's _La prise de la Bastille, 14 juillet 1789_ (1965). For instance,

> The electors . . . decided to send a delegation to the Bastille. The delegates got there at about teno'clock. De launey received them in friendly fashion at his residence, the 'Gouvernement', and as it was lunch time he invited them to share his meal. . . . But the delegation did not go so far; it merely asked the governor to take such measures as might allay the people's fears. De Launey assured the delegates that he would do no harm to the quartier Saint-Antoine, and gave orders for guns standing on the towers to be withdrawn and for the embrasures to be blocked with planks of wood.

De Launay is lynched by the mob on the way to the Hôtel de Ville. Danton and Camille Desmoulins arrive at the Bastille after fortress has already fallen.  

In the Palace of Versailles, served by his valet **Jean-Baptiste Cléry** (Geoffrey Bateman), Louis XVI writes down the famous line in his diary: 

> Mardi . . . . 14 &nbsp;Rien. <br />
>[Tuesday . . . . 14 &nbsp;Nothing.]

At night, Louis is informed of the seriousness of the fall of the Bastille by **François Alexandre Frédéric, duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt** (Yves-Marie Maurin):

> — Mais c'est donc une révolte ? <br />
> — Non, sire, c'est une révolution !
>
>[– Why, is this a revolt? — No, sire, it's a Revolution!]
