> Obviously freedom must carry with it the meaning of freedom to limit oneself, and one's material. Freedom is not infinite, not boundless liberty, as some hippies like to think—do anything you want, any time, anywhere you want to. No, freedom isn't that. It means being free to make decisions, to determine one's own course. But deciding means choosing and choosing is impossible without rejection. . . . Real freedom must contain within itself the freedom to un-choose as well as choose, to censor oneself to limit oneself. That is the whole meaning of democracy, the kind freedom on which we base our hopes for a peaceful world—just as it is the meaning of freedom in great musical composition. In Beethoven, as in democracy, freedom is a _discipline_, combining the right to choose freely, with the gift of choosing wisely.


> As you listen to these exalted final pages, try to keep in the back of your mind that there are two ways to think about all this. One way is that life is absurd to start with, that only a madman goes out and tries to change the world, to fight for good and against evil. The other way is that life is indeed absurd to start with and that it can be given meaning only if you live it for your ideals, visions and poetic truths, and despite all the skepticism of all the Sancho Panzas in the world, saddle up whatever worn-out horse you've got and go after those visions. Take your pick.
