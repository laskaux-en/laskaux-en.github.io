title: The Annotated Civilisation&colon;&nbsp; IV. Works of Sculpture

subtitle: 

excerpt: “‘Great nations write their autobiographies in three manuscripts, the book of their deeds, the book of their words and the book of their art. Not one of these books can be understood unless we read the two others, but of the three the only trustworthy one is the last.’ If I had to say which was telling the truth about society, a speech by a Minister of Housing or the actual buildings put up in his time, I should believe the buildings.”&ensp;[1]
