>Your god always wins. It is the longest unbeaten streak in the history of the world. Yet J. M. Christiansen fearlessly took up arms in that battle to oppose inevitable, throwing himself in at an enemy that has never known defeat and, as sure as I'm standing here, never will. . . . He and I spent our lives tilting at the very same windmills. So why have I not lost hope like he did? Because those windmills at which we tilted were created by men to turn grindstones that transformed the Earth's bounty into flour. From such humble beginnings grew the astonishing modern world in which we now live. . . .

>We now live in a time of endless possibility. More has been learned about the treatment of the human body in the last five years than was learned in the previous five hundred. Twenty years ago, 39 was the number of years a man could expect from his life. Today, it is more than 47. Eventually the train tunnels will crumble. The dams will be overrun. Our patients' hearts will all stop their beating. But we humans can get in a few good licks in battle before we surrender.
