Often as climaxes in the plot, dozens of surgical scenes are featured in the 20 episodes of _The Knick_. Below is a list of the major operations with brief descriptions. Enclosed in the brackets are the participating surgeons, the first of whom leads the procedure. Chickering, by default, refers to Dr. Bertram "Bertie" Chickering, Jr. 


----

01  CESAREAN SECTION  
[Christiansen, Thackery, Gallinger, and Chickering] 
In her third pregnacy, Mrs. Warren presents with a case of _placenta previa_. A caesarean delivery is attempted, but saves neither Warren nor the fetus, which is the twelfth failure of the same procedure in succession.  (101)

05  INGUINAL HERNIA REPAIR  
[Edwards] 
In his underground operating room, Edwards invents a three-layer hernia procedure and performs it on Mr. Cockrell. The repair is successful, but the patient dies later as he ignores the postoperative instruction of refraining from strenuous activity.  (103)

13  CESAREAN SECTION   
[Thackery and Chickering] 
By inventing the method of _intrauterine balloon tamponade_, which significantly reduces the danger of _postpartum hemorrhage_, Thackery and Chickering safely deliver the baby of a six-time multigravida.  (106) 


14  APPENDECTOMY

15  TRACHEOTOMY  
[Thackery] 
Thackery saves Ping Wu from choking by performing an emergency _tracheotomy_.  (107) 


16  TRAUMA SURGERY

17  TRAUMA SURGERIES  
[Thackery, Edwards, Gallinger, Chickering, Harriet, and Williams]

18  CERVICOFACIAL ACTINOMYCOSIS SURGERY

19  BRAIN TUMOR SURGERY  
[Thackery, Edwards, and Chickering]

21  BLOOD TRANSFUSION 
[Thackery] 
Thackery transfuses his own blood to a young patient suffering from _anemia_ caused by _chlorosis_. The girl is killed as a result of Thackery's erroneous understanding of human blood types.  
(110) 


22  RHINOPLASTY  
[Thackery]

23  CHOLECYSTECTOMY  
[Chickering and Edwards] 
During the operation, Edwards supervises Chickering to separate and ligate the two _cystic arteries_ within the patient's _cystohepatic triangle_, or _Calot's triangle_. (201) 


24  TUBERCULAR OSTEOMYELITIS SURGERY  
[Chickering and Mays]

25  RETINAL DETACHMENT REPAIR  
[Thackery] 
The previous fight left Edwards' retina almost separated from the rear wall of his left eye. An incision on the sclera is intended to release the subretinal fluid and thus have the retina in contact with the _choroid_. The operation, however, is terminated at its beginning due to Thackery's drug withdral and hallucinations. (202) 


26  HEPATIC CANCER SURGERY  
[Gallinger and Edwards]  
The doctors attempt to remove a tumor on the inferior surface of the patient's liver. Edwards instructs Gallinger to bisect the healthy liver tissue leading to the tumor and tie off all blood vessles contained within. (203) 


27  TRACHEOTOMY  
[Mays] 
While cauterizing the incision, Mays ignites the flammable ether and is killed by the fire.  (204) 


28  PYROTHERAPY OF NEUROSYPHILIS  
[Thackery and Edwards] 
(Not a surgery)  Thackery elevates Abigail's body temperature to 106 degrees Fahrenheit through the injection of malaria parasites. A higher therapeutic fever induced in a hypertherm cabinet effectively kills the _syphilis spirochetes_ (_Treponema pallidum_). Her malaria is subsequently cured by quinine. (204) 


29  TOPECTOMY  
[Thackery] 
Experimenting on Mr. Sidney Carton, who loses the top of his cranium but retains an intact brain, Thackery elicits the motional and emotional responses of the patient by stimulating selected points of his brain with electric currents. Furthermore, using a rheoscope, Thackery identifies a brain spot excited after injecting the patient with a dose of morphine. In a subsequent operation, Thackery surgically removes the "morphine region," but leaves Carton in a vegetative state. (205) 


30  TRAUMA SURGERIES  
[Thackery, Edwards, Gallinger, and Chickering]

31  ESOPHAGEAL CANCER SURGERY  
[Chickering, Edwards, and Zinberg] 
Several experimental methods are employed to treat the esophageal tumor of Anne Chickering, Bertie's mother. After trying _RÃ¶ntgenotherapy_, Bertie and Edwards attempt an ionic surgery by passing electric currents through mercury-coated zinc needles inserted into the tumor. After confirming its inefficacy, Bertie decides on the highly risky _laryngectomy_, which fails not unexpectedly due to the complex attachment of the tumor with the laryngeal, tracheal, and esophageal tissues. (206) 


32  SEPARATION OF OMPHALOPAGUS TWINS  
[Thackery, Edwards, Gallinger, and Chickering] 
Through X-ray examination, Thackery concludes that the only vital organ that Zoya and Nika---a pair of Minsk-borned twins conjoined by a band of cartilage and soft tissue in their midsection---share is their liver. After devising a procedure to bisect the liver with little hemorrhaging, the surgical team, including four doctors and six nurses, separate the twins after a three-and-a-half-hour battle. The entire operation is filmed by a motion picture camera. (207) 


33  UMBILICAL HERNIA REPAIR  
[Edwards and Gallinger] 
Mr. Garrison Carr is paralyzed on the operating table after Edwards injects his muscles attached to the aponeurotic membrane with a _curare_ solution secretly distilled by Gallinger, who then saves Carr in the emergency by a tracheotomy.  (207) 


34  SEPTOPLASTY 
[Thackery and Chickering] 
Thackery plans to place a celluloid insert into Abigail's nasal cavities to support her reconstructed nose. Abruptly, Abigail dies of an anesthetic reaction before the operation starts.  (208) 


35  INTESTINE RESECTION 
[Thackery, Gallinger, and Chickering] 
Traumatized by Abigail's sudden death of general anesthesia, Thackery insists on demonstrating a self-surgery and resecting his own necrotic intestine sections to promote spinal anesthesia. While continuing the procedure despite the unancipatedly complicated necrosis, Thackery accidentally cuts his abdominal aorta and loses his life in his own operating room. (210)
