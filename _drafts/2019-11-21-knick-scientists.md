The Polish doctor discovered the gland secretion existed. Doc at Johns Hopkins thought he'd crystalized it, but turned out he had only isolated a benzoyl derivative. Then this Japanese fellow on 103rd Street, he crystalized it for real. . . . He's the one who called it _adrenaline_.

>Radium radiations act energetically on the skin: the produced effect is analogous to that resulting from Röntgen rays. 
>
>The first observations of this action are due to MM. Walkoff and Giesel in 1900. M. Giesel applied to his arm radiferous radium bromide placed in a celluloid sheet for 2 hours. Radiations acting through the celluloid provoked a light red color of the skin. Two or three weeks later, the red color increased; an inflammation of the tissues appeared and skin sloughed off.
>
>M. Curie reproduced the Giesel experiment on himself, letting it act for 10 hours on his arm through a thin sheet of gutta percha the radiferous barium chloride of relatively low activity (approximately 5,000 times the activity of metallic uranium). After the action of the radiations the skin became red over a 6 cm<sup>2</sup> surface. The result was similar to that of a skin burn but the skin was not painful. After some days the red colour increased without spreading. On the 20th day, scabs were formed and then an open wound needing covering up. On the 42nd day, the epidermis started to recover around the wound, reaching the center, and 52 days after the action of the radiations an area of 1 cm<sup>2</sup> of a gray colouration remained, indicating a deeper necrosis.
>
>M. Becquerel, bringing a small sealed tube of a few decigrams of radiferous barium chloride of high activity level (800,000 times the activity of uranium), underwent the same experiment. . . . The tube, enclosed in a sheet of paper was inside a small cardboard box. On April 3 and 4, this small box was placed many times in a pocket of his jacket, the total time being assessed as 6 hours exposure. On April 13, he discovered that the radiations through the tube, the box and the clothes produced a red spot on the skin which became darker in the next days, marking in red the oblong size of the tube, with an oval shape of 64 cm<sup>2</sup>.
On April 24, the skin sloughed off and then the central part became ulcerated with a discharge. The wound was treated during one month using a bandage with oil and calcar. Necrosed tissues sloughed off and on May 22, which is 49 days after the irradiation, the wound was repaired, leaving a scar marking the position of the tube.
>
>We can add that M<sup>me</sup> Curie, carrying in a small sealed tube only a few centigrams of the same very active substance that gave the above mentioned lesions, presented with similar burns, although this little tube was enclosed in a thin metallic box. In particular, a short action less than 30 minutes produced 15 days later a red spot which was transformed into a blister similar to that due to a superficial burn that takes 15 days to be cured. These facts show that the duration of the lesion’s evolution varies according to the intensity of the radiation and the duration of the excitation action.
>
>After these acute effects we have described, we experimented on our hands the different actions during researches with these very active products. Hands have a general trend to become scaly and the extremities of the fingers which held tubes of capsules containing very radioactive products, become hard and sometimes very painful. For one of us, the inflammation of the extremities of the fingers lasted about 15 days and finished when the skin dropped off, but the painful sensation did not disappear for 2 months
