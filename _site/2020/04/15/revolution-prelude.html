<h4 id="-a-companion-to-la-révolution-française-1989"><br /> A companion to <em>La Révolution française</em> (1989)</h4>

<p>Prior to the bicentennial of the enlightening, electrifying, yet turbulent and ferocious Revolution that has reshaped human history forever, an international team of filmmakers, including the producer Alexandre Mnouchkine, screenwriters David Ambrose and Daniel Boulanger, historian Jean Tulard, and directors Robert Enrico and Richard T. Heffron, created a grand cinematic epic reenacting those years of illumination and terror. Personally, I find it among the most informative and pedagogical historical films one can ever imagine.</p>

<p>Below is an event-by-event breakdown of the film in the chronological order, with the following conventions:</p>

<p><strong>Historical figures</strong> are in bold text at their first appearances, with the corresponding (cast members) in parentheses.</p>

<p>Past tense is reserved for historical supplements to the plot.</p>

<p>Remarks on historical incompleteness or inaccuracies, including fictional adaptations, are highlighted in <em>italics</em>. <br /> <br /></p>

<h2 id="part-one-les-années-lumière">Part One: <em>Les Années lumière</em></h2>

<p>The first part of this panoramic historical film reenacts the last years of the Ancien Régime—from the convocation of the Estates-General of 1789 to the Insurrection of 10 August 1792.</p>

<p>Prior to its grand opening sequence featuring the Grand Canal and the Bassin de Latone in the Gardens of Versailles, the films nonetheless begins with a pre-edit scene back to 1775, when the 17-year-old <strong>Maximilien de Robespierre</strong> (Steve Carretero) delivers a Latin tribute to the newly crowned Louis XVI on behalf of his classmates at the Collège Louis-le-Grand, among whom stands the 15-year-old <strong>Camille Desmoulins</strong> (Philip-James Valentini).</p>

<p>This anecdote was noted down by the abbé Liévin-Bonaventure Proyart, then Robespierre’s teacher at Louis-le-Grand and later his biographer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>En 1775, Louis XVI, après la cérémonie de son sacre, fit son entrée solennelle dans Paris, accompagné de la reine et de la famille royale. Leurs majestés . . . s’arrêtèrent devant le collége de Louis-le-Grand, où elles furent complimentées par l’Université en corps. . . . et ce fut Robespierre que l’on chargea de le lui offrir au nom de ses condisciples, dans un discours en vers qu’avait composé son professeur. Le roi abaissa un regard de bonté sur ce jeune homme qui, élevé dans sa maison, devait un jour lui porter le premier coup de poignard. <br /></p>
  <p align="right">—Proyart, <em>La Vie de Maximilien de Robespierre</em> (1850)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Nevertheless, the record of this fateful encounter is generally considered unsubstantiated. Leastwise, it could not happen in 1774 according to the caption, as Louis XVI was crowned in Reims Cathedral on 11 June 1775.</em> <br /><br /></p>

<h4 id="royal-family-in-1788">Royal family in 1788</h4>

<p>At the opulent royal ball hosted in the Galerie des Glaces (Hall of Mirrors) of the Palace of Versailles, <strong>Louis XVI</strong> (Jean-François Balmer) and <strong>Marie-Antoinette d’Autriche</strong> (Jane Seymour, VF: Béatrice Delfe) make their first appearances. “Madame Déficit” is accompanied by her dancing partner <strong>Axel von Fersen</strong> (Jean-Yves Berteloot), her superintendent <strong>Marie-Thérèse-Louise de Savoie-Carignan, princesse de Lamballe</strong> (Gabrielle Lazure), and her favorite <strong>Gabrielle de Polastron, duchesse de Polignac</strong> (Claudia Cardinale). Polignac sits closer to the Queen at the casino table in the Salon de la Paix, reflecting Lamballe’s gradual falling out of favor since 1785.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, three royal childern appear at the Hameau de la Reine in the Petit Trianon of Versailles: Dauphin of France <strong>Louis-Joseph</strong> (Benji Marcus) riding a pony, his elder sister <strong>Marie-Thérèse Charlotte</strong>, or <strong>Madame Royale</strong> (Katherine Flynn), and their younger brother <strong>Louis-Charles</strong>, the future <strong>Louis XVII</strong> (Sean Flynn). Katherine and Sean are Seymour’s daughter and son in real life. <br /><br /></p>

<h4 id="21-january-1789-summoning-the-estates-general">21 January 1789: Summoning the Estates-General</h4>

<p>In the film, <strong>Jacques Necker</strong> (Raymond Gérôme), the esteemed Controller-General of Finances and Chief Minister of France, advices Louis XVI to summon the Estates-General in order to levy taxes to address the state deficit. <em>This decision-making process was, however, much more tortuous in history, where the idea of restoring this legislative and consultative assembly after more than 170 years was first deliberated on the Assembly of Notables in 1787.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘It seems to me’, declared Lafayette in the bureau where he sat on 21 May, ‘that this is the moment for us to beseech His Majesty to fix, immediately, in order to render account to him of all measures and settle their happy outcome forever, the convocation of a truly national assembly.’ ‘What, Sir,’ burst out the Count d’Artois, the king’s brother, ‘are you calling for the Estates-General?’ ‘Yes, my lord,’ replied the young glory-hunter, ‘and even better than that.’  [WD]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The date of the Estates-General was officially announced by the previous finance minister Étienne-Charles de Loménie de Brienne on 8 August 1788, before Necker’s return to office on 24 August. A royal edict—<em>Règlement des États généraux de 1789</em>—was issued on 24 January, followed by the nationwide elections of the delegates from the three estates of realm. <br /><br /></p>

<h4 id="marchapril-1789-elections">March–April 1789: Elections</h4>

<p>On 4 March 1789, inside a church in Guise, <strong>Camille Desmoulins</strong> (François Cluzet) plans to run for Estates-General deputy, together with his father <strong>Jean-Benoist-Nicolas Desmoulins</strong> (Jean-Marie Bernicat). Subsequently, Camille is compiling a Third-Estate <em>cahier de doléances</em>—a list of grievances raised by commoners, mainly against the privileges of the First and Second Estates. Camille unfortunately fails the election. <em>Omitted in the film, Jean-Benoist-Nicolas was nominated, but declined due to health reasons.</em></p>

<p>The disappointed Camille moves back to Paris. Walking down the Rue des Cordeliers (nowadays Rue de l’École-de-Médecine), he meets <strong>Antoine Simon</strong> (Alain Frérot) the shoemaker, and <strong>Louis Legendre</strong> (Jean-François Stévenin) the butcher, both politicians-to-be. Seconds later, he greets his future wife <strong>Lucile Desmoulins</strong> (Marie Bunel) and in-laws <strong>Claude-Étienne Laridon-Duplessis</strong> (François Lalande) and <strong>Anne-Françoise-Marie Bois de Veix</strong> (Geneviève Mnich). Apparently, M. Duplessis is not very fond of Camille at this moment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>. . . although Camille’s love for Lucile Duplessis grew with each meeting, his suit appeared too hopeless to be even hinted at to the girl’s parents. M. Duplessis would simply have laughed at him; Madame Duplessis might have been kinder, but she most certainly would not have consented to think of the young man as her daughter’s lover, desperately poor and desperately unsuccessful as he still was. <br /></p>

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few key figures during the coming Revolution are introduced next:</p>

<p>In a Parisian bar, the wealthy lawyer <strong>Georges Jacques Danton</strong> (Klaus Maria Brandauer, VF: Bernard Murat), reluctant to enter politics, chats with the influential <strong>Honoré-Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau</strong> (Peter Ustinov, VF: Roger Carel), who, despite his noble status, is going to represent the Third Estate. <strong>Jean-Paul Marat</strong> (Vittorio Mezzogiorno, VF: Michel Vigné), physician and scientist, has undertaken political writings, <em>whose</em> Offrande à la Patrie <em>was published earlier that year.</em></p>

<p><em>It is not evident how the trajectories of Mirabeau, Danton, Desmoulins, Simon, Legendre, and Marat intersected in early 1789.</em> Besides delineating the personal histories and dispositions of these characters, these scenes set up the community background of the future Club des Cordeliers.</p>

<p>While Mirabeau never conceals his passion for a colorful private life, Danton is known to be loyal to his wife <strong>Antoinette Gabrielle Danton</strong> (Marianne Basler), who, in the film, is carrying their future son Antoine. <em>However, Gabrielle’s pregnancy as depicted seems not synchronized with Antoine’s birth in June 1790.</em> <br /><br /></p>

<h4 id="5-may-1789-opening-of-the-estates-general">5 May 1789: Opening of the Estates-General</h4>

<p>This historic convention opens in the magnificent Hôtel des Menus-Plaisirs in Versailles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The royal session took place the following day in the Salle des Menus Galleries, arranged in the form of an amphitheatre, were filled with spectators. The deputies were summoned and introduced according to the order established in 1614. The clergy were conducted to the right, the nobility to the left, and the commons in front of the throne at the end of the hall.  [FAM]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/assets/img/revolution/estate-general.jpg" alt="Estate-general" /></p>

<p><em>Among the 1139 delegates were 291 clergmen, 270 nobles, and 578 commoners.</em> As depicted in the film, Louis XVI delivers a short opening speech, whose text is modified from the documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Sa Majesté.</strong>  . . . Puisse, Messieurs, un heureux accord régner dans cette Assemblée, et cette époque devenir à jamais mémorable pour le bonheur et la prospérité du royaume ! c’est le souhait de mon cœur, c’est le plus ardent de mes vœux, c’est enfin le prix que j’attends de la droiture de mes intentions et de mon amour pour mes peuples. Puisse, Messieurs, un heureux accord régner dans cette Assemblée, et cette époque devenir à jamais mémorable pour le bonheur et la prospérité du royaume ! c’est le souhait de mon cœur, c’est le plus ardent de mes vœux, c’est enfin le prix que j’attends de la droiture de mes intentions et de mon amour pour mes peuples.</p>

  <p>[AP, Tuesday 5 May 1789]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nicker addresses to the assembly for three hours regarding the financial situation.</p>

<p>More notable figures show up in this reenactment:</p>

<p>Sitting on the left-hand side of the Queen is <strong>Charles-Philippe, comte d’Artois</strong>, the youngest brother of Louis XVI and the future <strong>Charles X</strong> (André Penvern).</p>

<p>In the front row of nobility, we see <strong>Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette</strong> (Sam Neill, VF: Pierre Arditi). Even the 7-year-old Dauphin knows he is the hero of the American Independence War.</p>

<p>Among the clergy is the abbé <strong>Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès</strong> (Jean Bouchaud), political theorist and the author of <em>Qu’est-ce que le Tiers-État ?</em> [<em>What Is the Third Estate?</em>]</p>

<p>Camille Desmoulins, attending the convention as a spectator, greets his old classmate <strong>Maximilien de Robespierre</strong> (Andrzej Seweryn), a Third-Estate deputy for Arras.</p>

<p>After the session, Desmoulins reunites with Robespierre at the latter’s place. On the table lays a copy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, <em>Du contrat social; ou, Principes du droit politique</em> (first edition printed in 1762). They recollect the words of an old lecturer at Louis-le-Grand, which are resonant with the core questions in the abbé Sieyès’s <em>Qu’est-ce que le Tiers-État ?</em> (1789):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1º Qu’est-ce que le Tiers-État ? Tout. <br />
2º Qu’a-t-il été jusqu’à présent dans l’ordre politique ? Rien. <br />
3º Que demande-t-il ? À y devenir quelque chose.</p>

  <p>[1. What is the Third Estate? Everything;  2. What has it been hitherto in the political order? Nothing;  3. What does it desire to be? To become something.]</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="-20-june-1789-tennis-court-oath"><br /> 20 June 1789: Tennis Court Oath</h4>

<p>On June 4 1789, Louis-Joseph, Dauphin of France, dies at age seven of tuberculosis. Meanwhile, the tension between the estates in the convention ramps up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The immediate issue was that of voting procedures: while the Third Estate deputies refused to vote separately, the nobility was in favour (by 188 votes to 46) as, very narrowly, were the clergy (134 votes to 114). Ultimately, Louis’s acquiescence in the nobility’s demand for voting to be in three separate chambers galvanized the outrage of the bourgeois deputies.  [PM]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A series of following events lead to the formation of the Assemblée nationale on 17 June.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By the second week of the month (June) third-estate patience was running out. Against their previous resolutions, they had already begun to organize themselves and establish procedures, and on 3 June they elected Bailly as their president. There was now constant talk of unilateral action, of declaring the ‘Commons’ to be the national assembly, and of proceeding to verification of powers on that basis without further reference to the other two orders. On 10 June this talk at last culminated in a formal motion, moved by Sieyès, that a final appeal should be sent to the other two orders to join at once in common verification. Failing that, the Commons would proceed anyway. . . . It all played into Sieyès’s hands, and by the seventeenth he felt able to propose the title he had always wanted. By then an overwhelming majority recognized that there was no sensible alternative, and the name National Assembly was adopted by 491 votes to 89.  [WD]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its first president, <strong>Jean Sylvain Bailly</strong> (Michel Duchaussoy), astronomer and member of the Académie des sciences and the Académie française, presides over the solemn <em>serment du Jeu de Paume</em> on 20 June.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was feared that the majority of the clergy would recognise the assembly by uniting with it; and to prevent so decided a step, instead of hastening the royal sitting, they closed the Salle des Etats, in order to suspend the assembly till the day of the sitting. . . . At that time Bailly presided over the assembly. . . . At an appointed hour on the following day, he repaired to the Salle des Etats, and finding an armed force in possession, he protested against this act of despotism. In the meantime the deputies arrived, dissatisfaction increased, all seemed disposed to brave the perils of a sitting. . . . one named the Tennis-court; this proposition was well received, and the deputies repaired thither in procession. Bailly was at their head; the people followed them with enthusiasm; even soldiers volunteered to escort them, and there, in a bare hall, the deputies of the commons standing with upraised hands, and hearts full of their sacred mission, swore, with only one exception, not to separate till they had given France a constitution.  [FAM]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/assets/img/revolution/tennis-court.jpg" alt="Tennis Court Oath" /></p>

<p>The Oath can be found in <em>Gazette nationale ou le Moniteur universel</em>, the official newspaper during the Revolution:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>« Nous jurons de ne jamais nous séparer de l’Assemblée nationale, et de nous réunir partout où les circonstances l’exigeraient, jusqu’à ce que la Constitution du royaume fût établie et affermie par des fondements solides. »</p>

  <p>[“We swear never to separate from the National Assembly and to meet wherever circumstances require until the kingdom’s Constitution is established and grounded on solid foundations.”]</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="-23-june-1789-séance-royale"><br /> 23 June 1789: <em>Séance royale</em></h4>

<p>This dramatic royal session is centered around the conflict between the privileged and the reformers, starting from the King’s declarations nullifying the decisions of the National Assembly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Sa Majesté.</strong>  . . . Réfléchissez, Messieurs, qu’aucun de vos projets, aucune de vos dispositions ne peut avoir force de loi sans mon approbation spéciale. Ainsi, je suis le garant naturel de vos droits respectifs ; et tous les ordres de l’Etat peuvent se reposer sur mon équitable impartialité.</p>

  <p>Toute défiance de votre part serait une grande injustice. C’est moi, jusqu’à présent, qui fais tout le bonheur de mes peuples ; et il est rare peut-être que l’unique ambition d’un souverain soit d’obtenir de ses sujets qu’ils s’entendent enfin pour accepter ses bienfaits.</p>

  <p>Je vous ordonne, Messieurs, de vous séparer tout de suite, et de vous rendre demain matin chacun dans les Chambres affectées à votre ordre, pour y reprendre vos séances. . . .</p>

  <p>[AP, Tuesday 23 June 1789]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The subsequent confrontation is recorded by multiple sources. As recalled by its main participant,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Le grand-maître des cérémonies s’approcha de moi, et me dit : Monsieur, vous avez entendu l’ordre du roi ? Je lui répondit : . . . Je crois que la nation assemblée ne peut pas recevoir d’ordre. . . . À la vérité, Mirabeau prit la parole et, s’emportant contre le grand-maître des cérémonies, dit à-peu-près ce qu’on a répété depuis : « Allez dire à ceux qui vous envoient que la force desbaïonnettes ne peut rien contre la volonté de la nation : » on a beaucoup loué cette réponse, . . . <br /></p>
  <p align="right">—Bailly, <em>Mémoires d'un témoin de la Révolution</em>, Tome 1<sup>er</sup> (1804)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A better-known version of Mirabeau’s defiance of the Grand Master of Ceremonies—<strong>Henri Evrard, marquis de Dreux-Brézé</strong> (Sebastian Roché)—is found in Adolphe Thiers’s <em>Histoire de la Révolution française</em>, Tome 1<sup>er</sup> (1823):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>« Allez dire à votre maître que nous sommes ici par la puissance du peuple, et qu’on ne nous en arrachera que
par la puissance des baïonnettes. »</p>

  <p>[“Go and tell your master that we are here by the power of the people, and that nothing bu the power of bayonets shall drive us away.”]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A prominent figurant: Nicolas Sarkozy as the Third-Estate deputy second to the left of Mirabeau. <br /><br /></p>

<h4 id="1213-july-1789-riots-in-paris">12–13 July 1789: Riots in Paris</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>In these circumstances he (Louis XVI) made the final surrender. On 27 June he wrote to the presidents of the clerical and noble orders ordering them to join the National Assembly.</p>

  <p>. . . Responsible men now looked forward to a period of dignified calm, allowing a return to normality and social harmony. Yet as July began there was little sign of that. On 26 June four regiments were ordered from the frontiers to the Paris region, and around the same time the king asked the veteran Marshal de Broglie to assume supreme command. On 1 July more troops were ordered up, making a fivefold increase, to well over 20,000, in less than a week. Nobody could fail to notice the build-up, or the number of foreign regiments involved, presumed to be more reliable than French ones. . . . At Court, the queen and Artois remained determined to get rid of Necker. . . . By 11 July they thought they had found them. That afternoon, the minister was presented with a royal letter dismissing him and ordering him to leave the country immediately.   [WD]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Counteractions of the royal court include the dismissal of Necker and the military deterrent. Marching in the film are three infantry and one calvary troops. Judging by their uniforms, they are likely to be (in the order of appearance): the Swiss Régiment de Castellas, the French Régiment du Dauphin dragons, the French Régiment de Provence, and the Swiss Régiment de Salis-Samade.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the following day, Sunday, the 12th of July, about four in the afternoon, Necker’s disgrace and departure became known at Paris. . . . In a short time the city was in the greatest confusion; crowds gathered together on every side; more than ten thousand persons flocked to the Palais Royal all affected by this news, ready for anything, but not knowing what measure to adopt. Camille Desmoulins, a young man, more daring than the rest, one of the usual orators of the crowd, mounted on a table, pistol in hand, exclaiming: “Citizens, there is no time to lose; the dismissal of Necker is the knell of a Saint Bartholomew for patriots! This very night all the Swiss and German battalions will leave the Champ de Mars to massacre us all; one resource is left; to take arms!” These words were received with violent acclamations. He proposed that cockades should be worn for mutual recognition and protection. “Shall they be green,” he cried, “the colour of hope; or red, the colour of the free order of Cincinnatus?” “Green! green!” shouted the multitude. The speaker descended from the table, and fastened the sprig of a tree in his hat. Every one imitated him. The chestnut-trees of the palace were almost stripped of their leaves . . .  [FAM]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/assets/img/revolution/desmoulins.jpg" alt="Cafe de Foy" /></p>

<p>This inspiring speech at the Café de Foy near the Galerie de Montpensier in the Palais-Royal is vividly reenacted in the film. So is the attack on the multitude in the Tuileries Garden by the German Régiment Royal-Allemand cavalerie commanded by <strong>Charles Eugène de Lorraine, prince de Lambesc</strong> (Mario Luraschi).</p>

<p>In the meantime, Danton launches his political career by orating at the Club des Cordeliers, <em>although its synchronization with the Parisian insurrections is probably fictional.</em> Among the enthusiastic crowd are Marat, Legendre, Simon, and the Saint-Domingue distiller <strong>Claude Fournier l’Américain</strong> (Georges Trillat). <br /><br /></p>

<h4 id="14-july-1789-storming-of-the-bastille">14 July 1789: Storming of the Bastille</h4>

<p>The Bastille, demolished in late 1789, is “reconstructed” using the Château de Tarascon in Bouches-du-Rhône. Most narrative of this siege and sieze is historically accurate.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/revolution/bastille.jpg" alt="Bastille" /></p>

<p>The commanders of defense are <strong>Bernard René Jourdan, marquis de Launay</strong> (Henri Serre), governor of the Bastille, and Lieutenant <strong>Ludwig von Flüe/Louis de Flue</strong> (Philippe Chemin), commanding officer of the Swiss Guards from the Régiment de Salis-Samade. On the side of besiegers are <strong>Stanislas-Marie Maillard</strong> (Patrick Tessari), the “capitaine des volontaires de la Bastille,” who stands on a plank over the moat to get the letter from de Launay, and <strong>Pierre-Augustin Hulin</strong> (Bernard Lepinaux), who leads one of the two mutinous columns of Gardes Françaises. <strong>Jacques-Alexis Thuriot de la Rosière</strong> (Michel Melki) serves as the negotiator between the two sides.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the 13th the insurrection took at Paris a more regular character. . . .  A permanent committee was formed at the Hotel de Ville, to take measures for the general safety.</p>

  <p>The next day . . . an alarm was given that the regiments stationed at Saint Denis were on the march, and that the cannon of the Bastille were pointed on the Rue Saint Antoine. The committee immediately sent to ascertain the truth; appointed bands of citizens to defend that side of the town, and sent a deputation to the governor of the Bastille, soliciting him to withdraw his cannon and engage in no act of hostility. . . .</p>

  <p>A deputy of the district of Saint Louis de la Culture, named Thuriot de la Rosiere, then requested a parley with De Launay, the governor. When admitted to his presence he summoned him to change the direction of the cannon. The governor replied, that the cannon had always been placed on the towers, and it was not in his power to remove them; yet, at the same time, having heard of the alarm prevalent among the Parisians, he had had them withdrawn a few paces, and taken out of the port-holes. . . .</p>

  <p>But the impatient crowd now clamoured for the surrender of the Bastille. From time to time the cry arose, “The Bastille! we will have the Bastille!” At length, two men, more determined than the rest, darting from the crowd, sprang on a guardhouse, and struck at the chains of the drawbridge with heavy hatchets. The soldiers shouted to them to retire, and threatened to  re; but they continued to strike, succeeded in breaking the chains and lowering the bridge, and then rushed over it, followed by the crowd. In this way they advanced to cut the chains of the second bridge. The garrison now dispersed them with a discharge of musketry. . . .</p>

  <p>The siege had lasted more than four hours when the French guards arrived with cannon. Their arrival changed the appearance of the combat. The garrison itself begged the governor to yield. The unfortunate De Launay, dreading the fate that awaited him, wished to blow up the fortress, and bury himself under its ruins and those of the faubourg. He went in despair towards the powder magazine, with a lighted match. The garrison stopped him, raised a white standard on the platform, and reversed the guns, in token of peace. . . .

<blockquote>
  <p>The electors . . . decided to send a delegation to the Bastille. The delegates got there at about teno’clock. De launey received them in friendly fashion at his residence, the ‘Gouvernement’, and as it was lunch time he invited them to share his meal. . . . But the delegation did not go so far; it merely asked the governor to take such measures as might allay the people’s fears. De Launey assured the delegates that he would do no harm to the quartier Saint-Antoine, and gave orders for guns standing on the towers to be withdrawn and for the embrasures to be blocked with planks of wood.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Early on 17 July the Count d’Artois left Versailles for the north-east frontier, to be followed over subsequent weeks by many of the courtiers . . . And later the same day the king made his way, escorted only by a handful of deputies, to the Hôtel de Ville of Paris to confirm that the troops were withdrawing and announce that Necker had been recalled. He also confirmed the nomination of Bailly as mayor of Paris (a new title) and Lafayette as commander of the new citizens’ militia, now being called the National Guard. It was said that 150,000 armed citizens were on the streets that day, all wearing cockades in red and blue, the colours both of the city and the Duke d’Orlaéns. Later in the month Lafayette would splice them with Bourbon white for the uniform of his National Guardsmen, and so the patriotic tricolour was born. The king accepted a cockade and stuck it in his hat on arrival at the Hôtel de Ville; and then, for the first time, people began to cheer him.   [WD]</p>

<p>Together with comte d’Artois, the family of duchesse de Polignac left France, who never reunites with Marie-Antoinette thereafter. Louis’s visit to Paris on 17 July begins with a ceremonial key conferment <em>at the Barrière de Chaillot (rather than the Hôtel de Ville)</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>« J’apporte à votre Majesté les clés de sa bonne ville de Paris : ce sont les mêmes qui ont été présentées à Henri IV ; il avait reconquis son peuple, ici le peuple a reconquis son roi. »</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fear of aristocratic revenge replaced such hope as news of the Bastille arrived . . . Hope, fear, and hunger made the countryside a tinder-box ignited by imagined sightings of ‘brigands’. Panics spread from five separate sparks as bushfires of angry rumours, spreading from village to village at several kilometres an hour, engulfed every region but Brittany and the east. When noble revenge failed to materialize, village militias instead turned their weapons on the seigneurial system itself, compelling seigneurs or their agents to hand over feudal registers to be burned on the village square. This extraordinary revolt came to be known as the ‘Great Fear’.  [PM]</p>

<p>The resolutions were proclaimed as the <em>Décrets des 4, 6, 7, 8 et 11 août 1789</em>, or the August Decrees. <em>Slavery was not abolished throughout France until 1794.</em> <br /><br /></p>

<h4 id="26-august-1789-declaration-of-the-rights-of-man-and-of-the-citizen">26 August 1789: <em>Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</em></h4>

<p>The last article of the <em>Déclaration des droits de l’homme et du citoyen de 1789</em> was voted and adopted by the Assemblée nationale constituante (National Constituent Assembly) on 26 August. In the film, excerpts of its original text are read to the Assembly by La Fayette, who prepared its first draft on 11 July.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Les Représentants du Peuple Français, constitués en Assemblée Nationale, considérant que l’ignorance, l’oubli ou le mépris des droits de l’Homme sont les seules causes des malheurs publics et de la corruption des Gouvernements, ont résolu d’exposer, dans une Déclaration solennelle, les droits naturels, inaliénables et sacrés de l’Homme, . . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 1<sup>er</sup>.</strong>  Les hommes naissent et demeurent libres et égaux en droits. Les distinctions sociales ne peuvent être fondées que sur l’utilité commune.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 2.</strong>  . . . Ces droits sont la liberté, la propriété, la sûreté, et la résistance à l’oppression.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 3.</strong>  Le principe de toute Souveraineté réside essentiellement dans la Nation. . . .</p>

  <p>. . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 5.</strong>  La Loi n’a le droit de défendre que les actions nuisibles à la Société. Tout ce qui n’est pas défendu par la Loi ne peut être empêché, . . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 6.</strong>  La Loi est l’expression de la volonté générale. . . . Tous les Citoyens étant égaux à ses yeux sont également admissibles à toutes dignités, places et emplois publics, . . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 7.</strong>  Nul homme ne peut être accusé, arrêté ni détenu que dans les cas déterminés par la Loi, . . .</p>

  <p>. . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 9.</strong>  Tout homme étant présumé innocent jusqu’à ce qu’il ait été déclaré coupable, . . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 10.</strong>  Nul ne doit être inquiété pour ses opinions, même religieuses, . . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 11.</strong>  La libre communication des pensées et des opinions est un des droits les plus précieux de l’Homme : tout Citoyen peut donc parler, écrire, imprimer librement, sauf à répondre de l’abus de cette liberté dans les cas déterminés par la Loi.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 12.</strong>  La garantie des droits de l’Homme et du Citoyen nécessite une force publique : cette force est donc instituée pour l’avantage de tous, . . .</p>

  <p>. . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 17.</strong>  La propriété étant un droit inviolable et sacré, nul ne peut en être privé, si ce n’est lorsque la nécessité publique, légalement constatée, l’exige évidemment, . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The standard English translation is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The representatives of the French people, organized as a National Assembly, believing that the ignorance, neglect, or contempt of the rights of man are the sole cause of public calamities and of the corruption of governments, have determined to set forth in a solemn declaration the natural, unalienable, and sacred rights of man, . . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 1.</strong>  Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 2.</strong>  . . . These rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 3.</strong>  The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation. . . .</p>

  <p>. . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 5.</strong>  Law can only prohibit such actions as are hurtful to society. Nothing may be prevented which is not forbidden by law, . . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 6.</strong>  Law is the expression of the general will. . . . All citizens, being equal in the eyes of the law, are equally eligible to all dignities and to all public positions and occupations, . . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 7.</strong>  No person shall be accused, arrested, or imprisoned except in the cases and according to the forms prescribed by law. . . .</p>

  <p>. . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 9.</strong>  All persons are held innocent until they shall have been declared guilty, . . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 10.</strong>  No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, including his religious views, . . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 11.</strong>  The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 12.</strong>  The security of the rights of man and of the citizen requires public military forces. These forces are, therefore, established for the good of all . . .</p>

  <p>. . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 17.</strong>  Property is an inviolable and sacred right. No one shall be deprived thereof except where public necessity, legally determined, shall clearly demand it, . . .</p>

<p>Article 11 on freedom of the press was adopted on 24 August. Two impactful revolutionary newspapers were launched in the following fall: Jean-Paul Marat’s <em>L’Ami du peuple, or Le Publiciste parisien</em> and Camille Desmoulins’s <em>Révolutions de France et de Brabant</em>. <br /><br /></p>

<h4 id="september-1789-veto-debate">September 1789: Veto debate</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Admirers of the checks and balances of the British constitution dominated the Assembly’s constitutional committee, and they believed that the king should have the same powers of veto as the British monarch. Led by Mounier, Malouet, and a handful of rich and eloquent metropolitan nobles like Lally-Tollendal and Clermont-Tonnerre, and energetically supported by Mirabeau, these <em>monarchiens</em> (as their opponents dubbed them) spent the first two weeks of September trying to hustle the Assembly into accepting their programme. . . . But only a handful of deputies, such as Sieyès and the prolix but still uninfluential Robespierre, believed that once the National Assembly had pronounced the monarch should have no veto at all. Most, including patriotic leaders like Barnave, Duport, and the noble Lameth brothers, were attracted to the idea of a temporary or ‘suspensive’ veto; and when Necker let it be known that this was also the king’s preference, they detected a hint that the August decrees would be sanctioned if it was carried. Consequently the suspensive veto passed overwhelmingly (673 votes to 352) on 15 September.  [WD]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>This tortuous deliberation started as early as in June on the Estates-General:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>M. le comte de Mirabeau.</strong>  . . . Et moi, Messieurs, je crois le veto du Roi tellement nécessaire que l’aimerais mieux vivre à Constantinople qu’en France, s’il ne l’avait pas . . . je ne connaîtrais rien de plus terrible que l’aristocratie souveraine de six cents personnes qui demain pourraient se rendre inamovibles, après-demain héréditaires, et finiraient, comme les aristocrates de tous les pays du monde, par toute envahir.</p>

  <p>[Gentlemen, I think the King’s veto so essential that I had rather live in Constantinople than in France if he did not have it. . . . I know nothing more terrible than the sovereignty of six hundred persons, who tomorrow will constitute themselves a permanent body, the next day hereditary, and will end by usurping everything.]</p>

  <p>[AP, Tuesday 16 June 1789]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the film, Mirabeau’s view is reflected through the witty dinner chat with Camille Desmoulins, whose friendship began in the summer of 1789:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was during these summer months, immediately after the fall of the Bastille, that the friendship began between Camille Desmoulins and Gabriel-Honoré de Riquetti, Comte de Mirabeau. . . .</p>

  <p>It would appear that Camille first brought himself to the notice of the great Revolutionary Tribune as early as the spring of 1789, by asking for a post on the staff of the paper which Mirabeau edited.</p>

  <p>Although there is no evidence that Camille ever contributed personally to Mirabeau’s paper, it is probable that the great man foresaw that the journalist might be useful to him in the future. . . .</p>

  <p>He made much of Camille, he invited him to his house, gave him such dinners as the young fellow had never probably conceived as possible, showed him life in more senses of the word than one.</p>

  <p>Camille was absolutely dazzled, and small wonder. Mirabeau was rapidly becoming the most prominent man of his day, and he was as great in fascination as in all else. Where he cared sufficiently to exert his power—and there is little doubt that he cared for Camille—he could be irresistible.</p>

<h4 id="1-october-1789-orgie-des-gardes-du-corps">1 October 1789: <em>Orgie des Gardes du corps</em></h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was the first time the Assembly had flouted popular sentiment, for in Paris and many of the provinces it was clear that any form of veto aroused deep mistrust. . . . Such paranoid attitudes were compounded by persistent economic difficulties in the capital. After falling somewhat in late July and August, the price of bread began to climb again and supplies became irregular. . . . Guards were placed on bakers’ shops, and Lafayette and his militia found themselves hard pressed to contain all the incidents that occurred.</p>

  <p>Parallels with the situation early in July escaped no one. . . . Alarmed at persistent rumours of being taken by force to Paris, on 14 September the king summoned the notoriously well-disciplined Flanders Regiment from the north-east frontier to Versailles. . . . . Encouraged by the security it seemed to promise, the king broke silence on the August decrees. On 18 September, in a long letter drafted by Necker, he explained that he was prepared to accept some parts of the 11 August decree but not others. . . . Then on 4 October he voiced reservations about the Declaration of Rights. By now, however, Paris was alive with rumours about a reception given by the King’s bodyguard on 1 October to welcome the Flanders Regiment. After many noisy toasts had been drunk, and none to the nation, the national cockade was said to have been trampled as the air rang with unpatriotic slogans.   [WD]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The banquet in honor of the Régiment de Flandre (in white uniforms) is hosted in the Opéra royal du château de Versailles by the Garde du corps du roi (in blue and red), whose major <strong>marquis d’Aguesseau</strong> (Jean-Gabriel Nordmann) proposes a toast. The orchestra are playing “Ô Richard, ô mon roi !,” an aria from André Grétry’s opéra comique <em>Richard Cœur-de-Lion</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During the banquet, toasts to the king and royal family were drunk with enthusiasm, while the nation was omitted or rejected. . . . Suddenly the king was announced; he entered attired in a hunting dress, the queen leaning on his arm, and carrying the dauphin. Shouts of affection and devotion arose on every side. . . . while cockades were distributed; the tri-coloured cockade, it is said, was trampled on . . .   [FAM]</p>

<h4 id="-56-october-1789-womens-march-on-versailles"><br /> 5–6 October 1789: Women’s March on Versailles</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Banquets themselves seemed unpatriotic when bread was so scarce, and by 4 October all Paris believed that counter-revolutionary orgies at Versailles were the prelude to a new attempt to starve the capital. The next morning, several districts of the city were awakened by the ringing of the tocsin from church bell-towers, recognized ever since the days of July as a call to arms. Crowds of women began to assemble at markets, from where they marched to the Hôtel de Ville. After surging through the building to impress the city authorities with their determination, late in the morning they set off for Versailles dragging cannon and brandishing whatever makeshift weapons they could lay hands on, recruiting newcomers as they went along. Perhaps 7,000 of them reached Versailles early in the evening and invaded the National Assembly, calling for bread and punishment for those who had insulted the national cockade. The unprotected deputies had no alternative but to welcome them with mollifying speeches. They were visibly relieved when a deputation went on to confront the king.   [WD]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/assets/img/revolution/women-march.jpg" alt="Women's March" /></p>

<p>Danton’s involvement in this insurrection can be found in Hilaire Belloc’s <em>Danton: A Study</em> (1899):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the morning of Sunday, a day when there was leisure to read, the walls were placarded with the manifesto of the Cordeliers. It demanded an insurrection, and was signed with Danton’s name. On Monday morning they rang the tocsin at the belfry of the convent, and the battalion of the district was drawn up and armed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leading the Women’s March is Stanislas-Marie Maillard, the same mod captain at the Bastille. The delegation is headed by <strong>Jean-Joseph Mounier</strong> (Jacques Penot), then president of the National Constituent Assembly, and includes <strong>Louison Chabry</strong> (Marion Grimault), a flowergirl who briefly appears at the beginning of the Café de Foy scene on 12 July.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mounier and the deputation, of which he was the head, six deputies of the Assembly and six women, who were joined by six other women, made their way with difficulty through the crowd in the Palace d’Armes, which had become a sea of pikes and muskets. The king received them with his customary graciousness.</p>

  <p>“Sire, we want bread,” said Louison Chabry, a pretty flower-girl of seventeen from the Palais-Royal, as speaker for the women.</p>

  <p>“I will order all the bread in Versailles to be collected and given to you,” declared the king.</p>

  <p>Louison, overcome by emotion at the king’s goodness, fainted. When she recovered her senses, she begged to kiss the king’s hand.</p>

  <p>“She deserves better than that,” said the king, and embraced her.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In the evening, Louis signs the August Decrees and the <em>Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</em>. At midnight, La Fayette and his National Guards arrive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The forces of order, in the shape of Lafayette and 20,000 National Guardsmen, arrived in Versailles later that night after a forced march through an autumnal downpour. Lafayette had been reluctant to come at all, leaving Paris unpoliced and thereby risking accusations that he was in complicity with the demonstrators. But his men insisted, and crowds outside the Hôtel de Ville were muttering about stringing him and Bailly up if they continued to temporize. When he arrived all he could do was try to ensure that what the populace wanted was brought about without disorder, and he formally requested the king, in the name of Paris, to return to the capital with him and take up residence in the Tuileries palace. The king made no promises that night, but early the next morning a number of Parisians found their way into the palace precincts and were fired on by royal bodyguards. Thereupon an enraged mob poured into the palace, massacred two guardsmen, and almost broke into the queen’s apartments. Only prompt action by unco-ordinated units of the National Guard contained them, and Lafayette bundled the royal family onto the palace balcony to stand under his personal protection. The impact on the volatile crowd milling below was favourable, but constant shouts of ‘To Paris!’ made clear that only one thing would really satisfy them. Late in the morning of 6 October the king announced that he would go.   [WD]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mob sneak through the Chapel Gate in the early morning, kill two guards—<strong>Miomandre de Sainte-Marie</strong> and <strong>Tardivet du Repaire</strong>—at the end of the Escalier de Marbre (Queen’s Marble Staircase), attempt to invade the Grand Appartement de la Reine but are stopped in the Queen’s Guard Room. Marie-Antoinette escapes from the Chambre de la Reine and takes refuge in the Grand Appartement du Roi, accompanied by princesse de Lamballe (in green, <em>yet no historical record for her presence</em>), and probably <strong>Adélaïde Genet, Madame Auguié</strong> (in ivory). In the Salon de l’Œil-de-Bœuf, they unite with Louis and the rest of the royal family—Madame Royale, Louis-Charles, and <strong>Élisabeth de France</strong> or <strong>Madame Élisabeth</strong> (Anne Létourneau, in white), Louis’s youngest sister. The childern are attended by their governess <strong>Louise-Élisabeth de Croÿ, marquise de Tourzel</strong> (Louise Latraverse). Later, Madame Auguié told this waking nightmare to her sister Jeanne-Louise-Henriette Campan, Première femme de Chambre:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About half-past four in the morning they heard horrible yells and discharges of firearms; one ran to the Queen to awaken her and get her out of bed; my sister flew to the place from which the tumult seemed to proceed; she opened the door of the antechamber which leads to the great guard-room, and beheld one of the Body Guard holding his musket across the door, and attacked by a mob, who were striking at him; his face was covered with blood; he turned round and exclaimed: “Save the Queen, madame; they are come to assassinate her!” She hastily shut the door upon the unfortunate victim of duty, fastened it with the great bolt, and took the same precaution on leaving the next room. On reaching the Queen’s chamber she cried out to her, “Get up, Madame! Don’t stay to dress yourself; fly to the King’s apartment!” The terrified Queen threw herself out of bed; they put a petticoat upon her without tying it, and the two ladies conducted her towards the oeil-de-boeuf. A door, which led from the Queen’s dressing-room to that apartment, had never before been fastened but on her side. What a dreadful moment! It was found to be secured on the other side. They knocked repeatedly with all their strength; a servant of one of the King’s valets de chambre came and opened it; the Queen entered the King’s chamber, but he was not there. Alarmed for the Queen’s life, he had gone down the staircases and through the corridors under the oeil-de-boeuf, by means of which he was accustomed to go to the Queen’s apartments without being under the necessity of crossing that room. He entered her Majesty’s room and found no one there but some Body Guards, who had taken refuge in it. The King, unwilling to expose their lives, told them to wait a few minutes, and afterwards sent to desire them to go to the oeil-de-boeuf. Madame de Tourzel, at that time governess of the children of France, had just taken Madame and the Dauphin to the King’s apartments. The Queen saw her children again. The reader must imagine this scene of tenderness and despair.</p>
  <p align="right">—<em>Memoirs of Madame Campan on Marie Antoninette and Her Court</em>, Vol. 2 (1909)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the request of La Fayette, the King and Queen confront the mob on the balcony facing the Cour de Marble:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>His Majesty himself has appeared with Lafayette on the balcony, and again appears: <em>Vive le Roi</em> greets him from all throats; but also from some one throat is heard, ‘<em>Le Roi à Paris</em>, The King to Paris!’</p>

  <p>Her Majesty too, on demand, shows herself, though there is peril in it : she steps out on the balcony, with her little boy and girl. ‘ No children, <em>Point d’enfans</em>! ‘ cry the voices. She gently pushes back her children; and stands alone, her hands serenely crossed on her breast: ‘Should I die,’ she had said, ‘I will do it.’ Such serenity of heroism has its eflPect. Lafayette, with ready wit, in his highflown chivalrous way, takes that fair queenly hand, and, reverently kneeling, kisses it: thereupon the people do shout <em>Vive la Reine</em>. Nevertheless, poor Weber ‘saw’ (or even thought he saw; for hardly the third part of poor Weber’s experiences, in such hysterical days, will stand scrutiny) ‘one of these brigands level his musket at her Majesty,’—with or without intention to shoot; for another of the brigands ‘angrily struck it down.’</p>

<p>Louis and the royal court move to the Tuileries Palace in the afternoon of 6 October.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A procession 60,000 strong accompanied Louis XVI and his queen on their nine-hour journey back to his capital that afternoon. . . . Nevertheless in the history of the Revolution the ‘October Days’ were decisive. Louis XVI never returned to Versailles. Henceforth he and his family would be confined to Paris, as a British observer put it, ‘more like prisoners than Princes’.   [WD]</p>
