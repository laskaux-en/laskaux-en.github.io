<h4 id="17-july-1789-reconciliation">17 July 1789: Reconciliation</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Early on 17 July the Count d’Artois left Versailles for the north-east frontier, to be followed over subsequent weeks by many of the courtiers . . . And later the same day the king made his way, escorted only by a handful of deputies, to the Hôtel de Ville of Paris to confirm that the troops were withdrawing and announce that Necker had been recalled. He also confirmed the nomination of Bailly as mayor of Paris (a new title) and Lafayette as commander of the new citizens’ militia, now being called the National Guard. It was said that 150,000 armed citizens were on the streets that day, all wearing cockades in red and blue, the colours both of the city and the Duke d’Orlaéns. Later in the month Lafayette would splice them with Bourbon white for the uniform of his National Guardsmen, and so the patriotic tricolour was born. The king accepted a cockade and stuck it in his hat on arrival at the Hôtel de Ville; and then, for the first time, people began to cheer him.   [WD]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Together with comte d’Artois, the family of duchesse de Polignac left France, who never reunites with Marie-Antoinette thereafter. Louis’s visit to Paris on 17 July begins with a ceremonial key conferment at the Barrière de Chaillot:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>« J’apporte à votre Majesté les clés de sa bonne ville de Paris : ce sont les mêmes qui ont été présentées à Henri IV ; il avait reconquis son peuple, ici le peuple a reconquis son roi. »</p>

  <p>[“I bring your Majesty the keys to his good city of Paris: these are the same ones that were presented to Henri IV; he had won back his people; here the people have won back their king.”]</p>

<h4 id="20-july6-august-1789-grande-peur">20 July–6 August 1789: <em>Grande Peur</em></h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fear of aristocratic revenge replaced such hope as news of the Bastille arrived . . . Hope, fear, and hunger made the countryside a tinder-box ignited by imagined sightings of ‘brigands’. Panics spread from five separate sparks as bushfires of angry rumours, spreading from village to village at several kilometres an hour, engulfed every region but Brittany and the east. When noble revenge failed to materialize, village militias instead turned their weapons on the seigneurial system itself, compelling seigneurs or their agents to hand over feudal registers to be burned on the village square. This extraordinary revolt came to be known as the ‘Great Fear’.  [PM]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the night of 4 August, in an extraordinary atmosphere of panic, self-sacrifice and exhilaration, a series of nobles mounted the rostrum of the Assembly to respond to the Great Fear by renouncing their privileges and abolishing feudal dues.  [PM]</p>

<p>This reenactment of the <em>Nuit du 4 août 1789</em> freatures five orators: <strong>Isaac René Guy le Chapelier</strong> (Bernard Spiegel),
<strong>Louis Marc Antoine, vicomte de Noailles</strong> (Georges Fricker),
<strong>Alexandre François Marie, vicomte de Beauharnais</strong> (Frédéric Rostand),
duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt (Yves-Marie Maurin), and
<strong>Anne-Louis-Henri de La Fare, évêque de Nancy</strong> (Jacques Plée).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>M. le Président</strong> (M. Chapelier) <br />

<p>The resolutions were proclaimed as the <em>Décrets des 4, 6, 7, 8 et 11 août 1789</em>, or the August Decrees. Slavery was not abolished throughout France until 1794. <br /><br /></p>

<h4 id="26-august-1789-declaration-of-the-rights-of-man-and-of-the-citizen">26 August 1789: <em>Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</em></h4>

<p>The last article of the <em>Déclaration des droits de l’homme et du citoyen de 1789</em> was voted and adopted by the Assemblée nationale constituante (National Constituent Assembly) on 26 August. In the film, excerpts of its original text are read to the Assembly by La Fayette, who prepared its first draft on 11 July.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Les Représentants du Peuple Français, constitués en Assemblée Nationale, considérant que l’ignorance, l’oubli ou le mépris des droits de l’Homme sont les seules causes des malheurs publics et de la corruption des Gouvernements, ont résolu d’exposer, dans une Déclaration solennelle, les droits naturels, inaliénables et sacrés de l’Homme, . . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 1<sup>er</sup>.</strong>  Les hommes naissent et demeurent libres et égaux en droits. Les distinctions sociales ne peuvent être fondées que sur l’utilité commune.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 2.</strong>  . . . Ces droits sont la liberté, la propriété, la sûreté, et la résistance à l’oppression.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 3.</strong>  Le principe de toute Souveraineté réside essentiellement dans la Nation. . . .</p>

  <p>. . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 5.</strong>  La Loi n’a le droit de défendre que les actions nuisibles à la Société. Tout ce qui n’est pas défendu par la Loi ne peut être empêché, . . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 6.</strong>  La Loi est l’expression de la volonté générale. . . . Tous les Citoyens étant égaux à ses yeux sont également admissibles à toutes dignités, places et emplois publics, . . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 7.</strong>  Nul homme ne peut être accusé, arrêté ni détenu que dans les cas déterminés par la Loi, . . .</p>

  <p>. . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 9.</strong>  Tout homme étant présumé innocent jusqu’à ce qu’il ait été déclaré coupable, . . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 10.</strong>  Nul ne doit être inquiété pour ses opinions, même religieuses, . . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 11.</strong>  La libre communication des pensées et des opinions est un des droits les plus précieux de l’Homme : tout Citoyen peut donc parler, écrire, imprimer librement, sauf à répondre de l’abus de cette liberté dans les cas déterminés par la Loi.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 12.</strong>  La garantie des droits de l’Homme et du Citoyen nécessite une force publique : cette force est donc instituée pour l’avantage de tous, . . .</p>

  <p>. . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 17.</strong>  La propriété étant un droit inviolable et sacré, nul ne peut en être privé, si ce n’est lorsque la nécessité publique, légalement constatée, l’exige évidemment, . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The standard English translation is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The representatives of the French people, organized as a National Assembly, believing that the ignorance, neglect, or contempt of the rights of man are the sole cause of public calamities and of the corruption of governments, have determined to set forth in a solemn declaration the natural, unalienable, and sacred rights of man, . . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 1.</strong>  Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 2.</strong>  . . . These rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 3.</strong>  The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation. . . .</p>

  <p>. . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 5.</strong>  Law can only prohibit such actions as are hurtful to society. Nothing may be prevented which is not forbidden by law, . . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 6.</strong>  Law is the expression of the general will. . . . All citizens, being equal in the eyes of the law, are equally eligible to all dignities and to all public positions and occupations, . . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 7.</strong>  No person shall be accused, arrested, or imprisoned except in the cases and according to the forms prescribed by law. . . .</p>

  <p>. . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 9.</strong>  All persons are held innocent until they shall have been declared guilty, . . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 10.</strong>  No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, including his religious views, . . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 11.</strong>  The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 12.</strong>  The security of the rights of man and of the citizen requires public military forces. These forces are, therefore, established for the good of all . . .</p>

  <p>. . .</p>

  <p><strong>Article 17.</strong>  Property is an inviolable and sacred right. No one shall be deprived thereof except where public necessity, legally determined, shall clearly demand it, . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Article 11 on freedom of the press was adopted on 24 August. Two impactful revolutionary newspapers were launched shortly in the following fall: Jean-Paul Marat’s <em>L’Ami du peuple</em> (originally <em>Le Publiciste parisien</em>) and Camille Desmoulins’s <em>Révolutions de France et de Brabant</em>. <br /><br /></p>

<h4 id="september-1789-veto-debate">September 1789: Veto debate</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Admirers of the checks and balances of the British constitution dominated the Assembly’s constitutional committee, and they believed that the king should have the same powers of veto as the British monarch. Led by Mounier, Malouet, and a handful of rich and eloquent metropolitan nobles like Lally-Tollendal and Clermont-Tonnerre, and energetically supported by Mirabeau, these <em>monarchiens</em> (as their opponents dubbed them) spent the first two weeks of September trying to hustle the Assembly into accepting their programme. . . . But only a handful of deputies, such as Sieyès and the prolix but still uninfluential Robespierre, believed that once the National Assembly had pronounced the monarch should have no veto at all. Most, including patriotic leaders like Barnave, Duport, and the noble Lameth brothers, were attracted to the idea of a temporary or ‘suspensive’ veto; and when Necker let it be known that this was also the king’s preference, they detected a hint that the August decrees would be sanctioned if it was carried. Consequently the suspensive veto passed overwhelmingly (673 votes to 352) on 15 September.  [WD]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This tortuous deliberation started as early as in June on the Estates-General:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>M. le comte de Mirabeau</strong></p>

  <p>. . . Et moi, Messieurs, je crois le veto du Roi tellement nécessaire que l’aimerais mieux vivre à Constantinople qu’en France, s’il ne l’avait pas . . . je ne connaîtrais rien de plus terrible que l’aristocratie souveraine de six cents personnes qui demain pourraient se rendre inamovibles, après-demain héréditaires, et finiraient, comme les aristocrates de tous les pays du monde, par toute envahir.</p>

  <p>[Sirs, I think the King’s veto so essential that I had rather live in Constantinople than in France if he did not have it. . . . I know nothing more terrible than the sovereignty of six hundred persons, who tomorrow will constitute themselves a permanent body, the next day hereditary, and will end by usurping everything.]</p>

  <p>[AP, Tuesday 16 June 1789]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the film, Mirabeau’s view is reflected through the witty dinner chat with Camille Desmoulins, whose friendship begin in the summer of 1789:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was during these summer months, immediately after the fall of the Bastille, that the friendship began between Camille Desmoulins and Gabriel-Honoré de Riquetti, Comte de Mirabeau. . . .</p>

  <p>It would appear that Camille first brought himself to the notice of the great Revolutionary Tribune as early as the spring of 1789, by asking for a post on the staff of the paper which Mirabeau edited.</p>

  <p>Although there is no evidence that Camille ever contributed personally to Mirabeau’s paper, it is probable that the great man foresaw that the journalist might be useful to him in the future. . . .</p>

  <p>He made much of Camille, he invited him to his house, gave him such dinners as the young fellow had never probably conceived as possible, showed him life in more senses of the word than one.</p>

  <p>Camille was absolutely dazzled, and small wonder. Mirabeau was rapidly becoming the most prominent man of his day, and he was as great in fascination as in all else. Where he cared sufficiently to exert his power—and there is little doubt that he cared for Camille—he could be irresistible.</p>
  <p align="right">—Violet Methley, <em>Camille Desmoulins: A Biography</em> (1914)

</blockquote>

<p>The papers Desmoulins drafts and Mirabeau signs are probably for Mirabeau’s <em>Courrier de Provence</em>. <br /><br /></p>

<h4 id="1-october-1789-orgie-des-gardes-du-corps">1 October 1789: <em>Orgie des gardes du corps</em></h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was the first time the Assembly had flouted popular sentiment, for in Paris and many of the provinces it was clear that any form of veto aroused deep mistrust. . . . Such paranoid attitudes were compounded by persistent economic difficulties in the capital. After falling somewhat in late July and August, the price of bread began to climb again and supplies became irregular. . . . Guards were placed on bakers’ shops, and Lafayette and his militia found themselves hard pressed to contain all the incidents that occurred.</p>

  <p>Parallels with the situation early in July escaped no one. . . . Alarmed at persistent rumours of being taken by force to Paris, on 14 September the king summoned the notoriously well-disciplined Flanders Regiment from the north-east frontier to Versailles. . . . . Encouraged by the security it seemed to promise, the king broke silence on the August decrees. On 18 September, in a long letter drafted by Necker, he explained that he was prepared to accept some parts of the 11 August decree but not others. . . . Then on 4 October he voiced reservations about the Declaration of Rights. By now, however, Paris was alive with rumours about a reception given by the King’s bodyguard on 1 October to welcome the Flanders Regiment. After many noisy toasts had been drunk, and none to the nation, the national cockade was said to have been trampled as the air rang with unpatriotic slogans.   [WD]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The banquet in honor of the Régiment de Flandre (in white uniforms) is hosted in the Opéra royal du château de Versailles by the Garde du corps du roi (in blue and red). The orchestra are playing “Ô Richard, ô mon roi !,” an aria from André Grétry’s opéra comique <em>Richard Cœur-de-Lion</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During the banquet, toasts to the king and royal family were drunk with enthusiasm, while the nation was omitted or rejected. . . . Suddenly the king was announced; he entered attired in a hunting dress, the queen leaning on his arm, and carrying the dauphin. Shouts of affection and devotion arose on every side. . . . while cockades were distributed; the tri-coloured cockade, it is said, was trampled on . . .   [FAM]</p>

<h4 id="56-october-1789-womens-march-on-versailles">5–6 October 1789: Women’s March on Versailles</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Banquets themselves seemed unpatriotic when bread was so scarce, and by 4 October all Paris believed that counter-revolutionary orgies at Versailles were the prelude to a new attempt to starve the capital. The next morning, several districts of the city were awakened by the ringing of the tocsin from church bell-towers, recognized ever since the days of July as a call to arms. Crowds of women began to assemble at markets, from where they marched to the Hôtel de Ville. After surging through the building to impress the city authorities with their determination, late in the morning they set off for Versailles dragging cannon and brandishing whatever makeshift weapons they could lay hands on, recruiting newcomers as they went along. Perhaps 7,000 of them reached Versailles early in the evening and invaded the National Assembly, calling for bread and punishment for those who had insulted the national cockade. The unprotected deputies had no alternative but to welcome them with mollifying speeches. They were visibly relieved when a deputation went on to confront the king.   [WD]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Danton’s involvement in this insurrection can be found in Hilaire Belloc’s <em>Danton: A Study</em> (1899):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the morning of Sunday, a day when there was leisure to read, the walls were placarded with the manifesto of the Cordeliers. It demanded an insurrection, and was signed with Danton’s name. On Monday morning they rang the tocsin at the belfry of the convent, and the battalion of the district was drawn up and armed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leading the Women’s March is Stanislas-Marie Maillard (Patrick Tessari), the same mod captain at the Bastille. The delegation is headed by <strong>Jean-Joseph Mounier</strong> (Jacques Penot), then president of the National Constituent Assembly, and includes <strong>Louison Chabry</strong> (Marion Grimault), a flowergirl who briefly appears at the beginning of the Café de Foy scene on 12 July.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mounier and the deputation, of which he was the head, six deputies of the Assembly and six women, who were joined by six other women, made their way with difficulty through the crowd in the Palace d’Armes, which had become a sea of pikes and muskets. The king received them with his customary graciousness.</p>

  <p>“Sire, we want bread,” said Louison Chabry, a pretty flower-girl of seventeen from the Palais-Royal, as speaker for the women.</p>

  <p>“I will order all the bread in Versailles to be collected and given to you,” declared the king.</p>

  <p>Louison, overcome by emotion at the king’s goodness, fainted. When she recovered her senses, she begged to kiss the king’s hand.</p>

  <p>“She deserves better than that,” said the king, and embraced her.</p>
  <p align="right">—George H. Allen, <em>The French Revolution</em> (1923)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the evening, Louis signs the August Decrees and the <em>Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</em>. At midnight, La Fayette and his National Guard arrive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The forces of order, in the shape of Lafayette and 20,000 National Guardsmen, arrived in Versailles later that night after a forced march through an autumnal downpour. Lafayette had been reluctant to come at all, leaving Paris unpoliced and thereby risking accusations that he was in complicity with the demonstrators. But his men insisted, and crowds outside the Hôtel de Ville were muttering about stringing him and Bailly up if they continued to temporize. When he arrived all he could do was try to ensure that what the populace wanted was brought about without disorder, and he formally requested the king, in the name of Paris, to return to the capital with him and take up residence in the Tuileries palace. The king made no promises that night, but early the next morning a number of Parisians found their way into the palace precincts and were fired on by royal bodyguards. Thereupon an enraged mob poured into the palace, massacred two guardsmen, and almost broke into the queen’s apartments. Only prompt action by unco-ordinated units of the National Guard contained them, and Lafayette bundled the royal family onto the palace balcony to stand under his personal protection. The impact on the volatile crowd milling below was favourable, but constant shouts of ‘To Paris!’ made clear that only one thing would really satisfy them. Late in the morning of 6 October the king announced that he would go.   [WD]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mob sneak through the Chapel Gate in the early morning, kill two guards—<strong>Miomandre de Sainte-Marie</strong> and <strong>Tardivet du Repaire</strong>—at the end of the Escalier de Marbre (Queen’s Marble Staircase), attempt to invade the Grand Appartement de la Reine but are stopped in the Queen’s Guard Room. Marie-Antoinette escapes from the Chambre de la Reine and takes refuge in the Grand Appartement du Roi, accompanied by princesse de Lamballe (in green, yet no historical record for her presence), and probably <strong>Adélaïde Genet, Madame Auguié</strong> (in ivory, no credit found). In the Salon de l’Œil-de-Bœuf, they unite with Louis and the rest of the royal family—Madame Royale, Louis-Charles, and <strong>Élisabeth de France</strong> or <strong>Madame Élisabeth</strong> (Anne Létourneau), Louis’s youngest sister (in white). The childern are attended by their governess <strong>Louise-Élisabeth de Croÿ, duchesse de Tourzel</strong> (Louise Latraverse). Later, Madame Auguié told this waking nightmare to her sister Jeanne-Louise-Henriette Campan, Première femme de Chambre:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About half-past four in the morning they heard horrible yells and discharges of firearms; one ran to the Queen to awaken her and get her out of bed; my sister flew to the place from which the tumult seemed to proceed; she opened the door of the antechamber which leads to the great guard-room, and beheld one of the Body Guard holding his musket across the door, and attacked by a mob, who were striking at him; his face was covered with blood; he turned round and exclaimed: “Save the Queen, madame; they are come to assassinate her!” She hastily shut the door upon the unfortunate victim of duty, fastened it with the great bolt, and took the same precaution on leaving the next room. On reaching the Queen’s chamber she cried out to her, “Get up, Madame! Don’t stay to dress yourself; fly to the King’s apartment!” The terrified Queen threw herself out of bed; they put a petticoat upon her without tying it, and the two ladies conducted her towards the oeil-de-boeuf. A door, which led from the Queen’s dressing-room to that apartment, had never before been fastened but on her side. What a dreadful moment! It was found to be secured on the other side. They knocked repeatedly with all their strength; a servant of one of the King’s valets de chambre came and opened it; the Queen entered the King’s chamber, but he was not there. Alarmed for the Queen’s life, he had gone down the staircases and through the corridors under the oeil-de-boeuf, by means of which he was accustomed to go to the Queen’s apartments without being under the necessity of crossing that room. He entered her Majesty’s room and found no one there but some Body Guards, who had taken refuge in it. The King, unwilling to expose their lives, told them to wait a few minutes, and afterwards sent to desire them to go to the oeil-de-boeuf. Madame de Tourzel, at that time governess of the children of France, had just taken Madame and the Dauphin to the King’s apartments. The Queen saw her children again. The reader must imagine this scene of tenderness and despair.</p>
  <p align="right">—<em>Memoirs of Madame Campan on Marie Antoninette and Her Court</em>, Vol. 2 (1909)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the request of La Fayette, the King and Queen confront the mob on the balcony facing the Cour de Marble:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>His Majesty himself has appeared with Lafayette on the balcony, and again appears: <em>Vive le Roi</em> greets him from all throats; but also from some one throat is heard, ‘<em>Le Roi à Paris</em>, The King to Paris!’</p>

  <p>Her Majesty too, on demand, shows herself, though there is peril in it : she steps out on the balcony, with her little boy and girl. ‘ No children, <em>Point d’enfans</em>! ‘ cry the voices. She gently pushes back her children; and stands alone, her hands serenely crossed on her breast: ‘Should I die,’ she had said, ‘I will do it.’ Such serenity of heroism has its eflPect. Lafayette, with ready wit, in his highflown chivalrous way, takes that fair queenly hand, and, reverently kneeling, kisses it: thereupon the people do shout <em>Vive la Reine</em>. Nevertheless, poor Weber ‘saw’ (or even thought he saw; for hardly the third part of poor Weber’s experiences, in such hysterical days, will stand scrutiny) ‘one of these brigands level his musket at her Majesty,’—with or without intention to shoot; for another of the brigands ‘angrily struck it down.’</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Louis and the royal court moved to the Tuileries Palace in the afternoon of 6 October.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A procession 60,000 strong accompanied Louis XVI and his queen on their nine-hour journey back to his capital that afternoon. . . . Nevertheless in the history of the Revolution the ‘October Days’ were decisive. Louis XVI never returned to Versailles. Henceforth he and his family would be confined to Paris, as a British observer put it, ‘more like prisoners than Princes’.   [WD]</p>

<h4 id="2-july-1790-mirabeaus-rendezvous-with-the-queen">2 July 1790: Mirabeau’s rendezvous with the Queen</h4>

<p>The secret meeting of Mirabeau and Marie-Antoinette in the park of the Château de Saint-Cloud is substantiated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On July 2d, he went to stay, as he often did, with his niece, Madame d’Aragon, at Passy. Very early in the morning of the following day, he took a cabriolet, and with his nephew, young du Saillant, disguised and acting as a postilion, drove through the quiet summer lanes which then led from Passy to Saint-Cloud. At an unfrequented entrance to the park he left the cabriolet and his nephew: a door was mysteriously opened to admit him and closed again.</p>

  <p>In a summer-house, in the highest part of the gardens of Saint-Cloud, Mirabeau met the Queen, alone.</p>

  <p>. . . One story has it (there are several differing versions) that when she first saw the man who she believed had “led a band of outlaws to assassinate” the royal family at Versailles, she drew back with “a movement of horror.” That passed. . . . But he won her, as he won everybody.</p>

  <p>. . . She spoke afterwards of the deep impression he made upon her. He himself alluded to the interview with a profound feeling, and often to her grace, her dignity, and her charm. Before they parted, it is said that he raised her hand to his lips: “Madame, the monarchy is saved!”</p>

  <p>What is certain, is that the interview left him with a yet more resolute determination to serve her: that he imbued her with his master idea, of making the National party the King’s party, and that his influence upon her mind can be traced long after his death.</p>

<p>The confidential letters mentioned in the dialogue refer to Mirabeau’s <em>Notes to the Court</em>, which were conveyed by Auguste d’Arenberg, comte de La Marck. From June 1790 to March 1791, Mirabeau averaged two notes a week to the Court. Fifty of them are preserved. Many were destroyed after Mirabeau’s death and the insurrection of 10 August 1792.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the afternoon M. Goguenot returned. He had 
still the seals of France about him, and he brought me a statement of all he had burnt. . . . The most voluminous was that from Mirabeau. It was tied up with a scheme for an escape, which he thought necessary.</p>

<p>Fifty of these notes still exist. <br /> <br /></p>

<h4 id="14-july-1790-fête-de-la-fédération">14 July 1790: <em>Fête de la Fédération</em></h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>The 14th of July approached: that day was regarded by the nation as the anniversary of its deliverance, and preparations were made to celebrate it with a solemnity calculated to elevate the souls of the citizens, and to strengthen the common bonds of union. A confederation of the whole kingdom was appointed to take place in the Champ de Mars; and there, in the open air, the deputies sent by the eighty-three departments, the national representatives, the Parisian guard, and the monarch, were to take the oath to the constitution. . . . The immense preparations were scarcely completed in time; all Paris had been engaged for several weeks in getting the arrangements ready by the 14th.   [FAM]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the construction scene shown in the film involving Parisians from all occupations, during which time Camille and Lucile Desmoulins get engaged. This is however an anachronism: in reality, M. and M<sup>me</sup> Duplessis did not sent their blessing until December 1790.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The vast space of the Champ de Mars was inclosed by raised seats of turf, occupied by four hundred thousand spectators. An antique altar was erected in the middle; and around it, on a vast amphitheatre, were the king, his family, the assembly, and the corporation. . . .</p>

  <p>A profound silence now reigned in the vast inclosure, and Lafayette, appointed that day to the command in chief of all the national guards of the kingdom, advanced first to take the civic oath. Borne on the arms of grenadiers to the altar of the country, amidst the acclamations of the people, he exclaimed with a loud voice, in his own name, and that of the federates and troops: “We swear eternal fidelity to the nation, the law, and the king; to maintain to the utmost of our power the constitution decreed by the national assembly, and accepted by the king; and to remain united with every Frenchman by the indissoluble ties of fraternity.” Forthwith the firing of cannon, prolonged cries of “Vive la nation!” “Vive le roi!” and sounds of music, mingled in the air. The president of the national assembly took the same oath, and all the deputies repeated it with one voice. Then Louis XVI. rose and said: “I, king of the French, swear to employ all the power delegated to me by the constitutional act of the state, in maintaining the constitution decreed by the national assembly and accepted by me.” The queen, carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment, rose, lifted up the dauphin in her arms, and showing him to the people, exclaimed: “Behold my son, he unites with me in the same sentiments.” At that moment the banners were lowered, the acclamations of the people were heard, and the subjects believed in the sincerity of the monarch, the monarch in the affection of the subjects, and this happy day closed with a hymn of thanksgiving.   [FAM]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another anachronism: Danton was elected as a member of the Provisional Commune of Paris in January 1790, but the No. 46 of Camille Desmoulins’s <em>Révolutions de France et de Brabant</em> was published on 5 October 1790—the first Anniversary of the October Days.
Desmoulins’s famous <em>Discours de la lanterne aux Parisiens</em>—the defense of political violence earning him the title ““Procureur-général de la lanterne”—was nonetheless published in September 1789, before the founding of <em>Révolutions de France et de Brabant</em>. All of them are asynchronized with the preparation of <em>Fête de la Fédération</em> in June 1790.</p>

<p>This concludes the narrative of the first year of the Revolution.</p>
