 (106) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>14  APPENDECTOMY</strong>  [Christiansen and Thackery] <br />

<p><strong>19  BRAIN TUMOR SURGERY</strong>  [Thackery, Edwards, and Chickering]  <br />
Before dealing with the tumor, Thackery relieves the patient’s intracranial pressure through <em>cranial trephination</em>. The hole is left open after the operation.

 (201) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>23  CHOLECYSTECTOMY</strong>  [Chickering and Edwards] <br />

 (201) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>24  TUBERCULAR OSTEOMYELITIS SURGERY</strong>  [Chickering and Mays] <br />

 (201) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>25  RETINAL DETACHMENT REPAIR</strong>  [Thackery] <br />
The previous fight left Edwards’ retina almost separated from the rear wall of his left eye. An incision on the sclera is intended to release the subretinal fluid and thus have the retina in contact with the <em>choroid</em>. The operation, however, is terminated at its beginning due to Thackery’s drug withdral and hallucinations.
 (202) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>26  HEPATIC CANCER SURGERY</strong>  [Gallinger and Edwards]  <br />
The doctors attempt to remove a tumor on the inferior surface of the patient’s liver. Edwards instructs Gallinger to bisect the healthy liver tissue leading to the tumor and tie off all blood vessles contained within.
 (203) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>27  TRACHEOTOMY</strong>  [Mays] <br />
While cauterizing the incision, Mays ignites the flammable ether and is killed by the fire. 
 (204) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>28  PYROTHERAPY OF NEUROSYPHILIS</strong>  [Thackery and Edwards] <br />
(Not a surgery)  Thackery elevates Abigail’s body temperature to 106 degrees Fahrenheit through the injection of malaria parasites. A higher therapeutic fever induced in a hypertherm cabinet effectively kills the <em>syphilis spirochetes</em> (<em>Treponema pallidum</em>). Her malaria is subsequently cured by <em>quinine</em>.
 (204) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>29  TOPECTOMY</strong>  [Thackery] <br />
Experimenting on Mr. Sidney Carton, who loses the top of his cranium but retains an intact brain, Thackery elicits the motional and emotional responses of the patient by stimulating selected points of his brain with electric currents. Furthermore, using a rheoscope, Thackery identifies a brain spot excited after injecting the patient with a dose of morphine. In a subsequent operation, Thackery surgically removes the “morphine region,” but leaves Carton in a vegetative state.
 (205) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>30  TRAUMA SURGERIES</strong>  [Thackery, Edwards, Gallinger, and Chickering] <br />
The staff of the Knick treat 124 injurers from the construction accident of the New York City subway system, in which six people die and 150 wounded.
 (205) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>31  ESOPHAGEAL CANCER SURGERY</strong>  [Chickering, Edwards, and Zinberg] <br />
Several experimental methods are employed to treat the esophageal tumor of Anne Chickering, Bertie’s mother. After experimenting with <em>Röntgenotherapy</em>, Bertie and Edwards attempt an ionic surgery by passing electric currents through mercury-coated zinc needles inserted into the tumor. After confirming its inefficacy, Bertie decides on the highly risky <em>laryngectomy</em>, which fails not unexpectedly due to the complex attachment of the tumor with the laryngeal, tracheal, and esophageal tissues.
 (206) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>32  SEPARATION OF OMPHALOPAGUS TWINS</strong>  [Thackery, Edwards, Gallinger, and Chickering] <br />
Through X-ray examination, Thackery concludes that the only vital organ that Zoya and Nika—a pair of Minsk-borned twins conjoined by a band of cartilage and soft tissue in their midsection—share is their liver. After devising a procedure to bisect the liver with little hemorrhaging, the surgical team—four doctors and six nurses—separates the twins after a three-and-a-half-hour battle. The entire operation is filmed by a motion picture camera.
 (207) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>33  UMBILICAL HERNIA REPAIR</strong>  [Edwards and Gallinger] <br />
Mr. Garrison Carr is paralyzed on the operating table after Edwards injects his muscles attached to the aponeurotic membrane with a <em>curare</em> solution secretly distilled by Gallinger, who then saves Carr in the emergency by a tracheotomy. 
 (207) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>34  SEPTOPLASTY</strong> [Thackery and Chickering] <br />
Thackery plans to place a celluloid insert into Abigail’s nasal cavities to support her reconstructed nose. Unfortunately, Abigail dies of an anesthetic reaction before the operation starts. 
 (208) <br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>35  INTESTINE RESECTION</strong> [Thackery, Gallinger, and Chickering] <br />
Traumatized by Abigail’s sudden death of general anesthesia, Thackery insists on demonstrating a self-surgery and resecting his own necrotic intestine sections to promote spinal anesthesia. While continuing the procedure despite the unancipatedly complicated necrosis, Thackery accidentally cuts his abdominal aorta and loses his life in his own operating room.
